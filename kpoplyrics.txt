The look of you when I open my eyes
So bright that I couldn’t dare to approach
My heart that wants to be like you
Gets colored, filled with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Willing to get closer to the sun
Flapping of the burnt wings
My miserable appearances
Only then I learnt my new days
[Chorus]
All my life by my life
Take a look at me now
All my life by my life

[Verse 2]
Blooming like sweet seduction
Another shape of me found inside of me
My face in the mirror
I ask myself who it is

[Pre-Chorus]
In the cold breeze of early morning
Pulsating heart
That moment I looked myself squarely
I realized my new face

[Chorus]
All my life by my life
Soar up into the sky now
All my life by my life

[Bridge]
It all seemed to reachable
The lights on the stage drift apart
Light, the beam inside of my heart
When it shines on my dream quietly
[Chorus]
The new me learnt about me
Always, always all my life
Refreshed new days
All my life by my life

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah-eh
Always all my life
I’ll trust myself, all my life
No matter what, by my life
With bright lights, all my life
I’ll hold myself, all my life

I can't understand what people are sayin'
Who and what do I need to follow
With each step then again grows the shadow
Where is this place I open my eyes to
Maybe Seoul or New York or Paris
I get up, unsteady on my feet (Yeah)

[Verse 2: RM]
(Look) Look at my feet, look down
The shadow resembles me
Is it the shadow that's shaking
Or is it my feet that are trembling
Of course I'm not unafraid
Of course it's not all okay
But I know
Awkwardly I flow
I fly together with that black wind
[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jung Kook, Jin]
(Hey, na-na-na) Gotta go insane to stay sane
(Hey, na-na-na) Throw myself whole into both worlds
(Hey, na-na-na) Can't hold me down 'cause you know I'm a fighter
Carried myself into this beautiful prison
Find me and I'm gonna live with ya

[Chorus: Jung Kook & Jimin, Jung Kook, Jimin]
(Eh-oh) Bring it, bring the pain, oh yeah
(Eh-oh) Come on up, bring the pain, oh yeah
Rain be pourin', sky keep fallin'
Everyday, oh na-na-na
(Eh-oh) Bring it, bring the pain, oh yeah

[Verse 3: j-hope]
Bring the pain
It'll become my blood and flesh
Bring the pain
No fear, now that I know the way
Breathe on the small things
My air and my light in the dark
The power of the things that make me, "me"
Even if I fall, I come right up, scream

[Verse 4: SUGA]
Even if I fall, I come right up, scream
That's how we've always been
Even if my knees drop to the ground
As long as they don't get buried
It's going to be just an ordinary happening
Win no matter what
Win no matter what
Win no matter what
Whatever you say, whatever they say
I don't give a uhh
I don't give a uhh
I don't give a uhh, yeah
[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, V, Jung Kook]
(Hey, na-na-na) Gotta go insane to stay sane
(Hey, na-na-na) Throw myself whole into both worlds
(Hey, na-na-na) Can't hold me down 'cause you know I'm a fighter
Carried myself into this beautiful prison
Find me and I'm gonna live with ya

[Chorus: Jung Kook & Jimin, V, Jin]
(Eh-oh) Bring it, bring the pain, on yeah
(Eh-oh) Come on up, bring the pain, oh yeah
Rain be pourin', sky keep fallin'
Everyday, oh na-na-na
(Eh-oh) Bring it, bring the pain, oh yeah

[Bridge: Jung Kook, Jimin]
Where my pain lies
Let me take a breath
My everythin'
My blood and tears
Got no fears, I'm singin', oh-oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh I'm takin' over
You should know yeah
Can't hold me down 'cause you know I'm a fighter
Choosing to descend into the dark abyss
Find me and I'm gonna bleed with ya
[Chorus: Jimin, V, Jin]
(Eh-oh) Bring it, bring the pain, on yeah
(Eh-oh) Come on up, bring the pain, on yeah
Rain be pourin', sky keep fallin'
Everyday, oh na-na-na
(Eh-oh) Find me and I'm gonna bleed with ya

[Post-Chorus: Jimin, Jung Kook, Jimin & Jung Kook]
(Eh-oh) Bring it, bring the pain, on yeah
(Eh-oh) Come on up, bring the pain, oh yeah
All that I know
Is just goin' on and on and on and on
(Eh-oh) Bring it, bring the pain, on yeah

The moment I noticed myself
I had to leave
I had to find out
All day all night
Across the desert and the sea
This wide, wide world
I wandered, Baby I

[Refrain: Jung Kook, V]
I could make it better
I could hold you tighter
On that long road
Oh you're the light
Uninvited
Unwelcome
The only one who recognized me
[Pre-Chorus: Jung Kook, Jin, Jimin]
This eternal night with no end in sight
It's you who gifted me the morning
Can I now hold that hand?
Ooh-ooh, I can make it right

[Chorus: Jimin, Jung Kook, V]
All right
All right
Ooh, I can make it right
All right
All right
Ooh, I can make it right

[Verse 2: j-hope]
I became a hero in this world
The loud screams that seek me out
My hand, trophy and a gold microphone
All day, everywhere
But all of this is about reaching you
It's the answer to my journey
I'm singing to find you
Baby to you

[Verse 3: RM]
A little taller than I was before
With a voice a little more solid
All of this to go back to you
Now I'll spread wide a map called you
My rehab
Look at me, why can't you recognize me?
I don't want to hear other people's noises
Your fragrance still penetrates and breaks me down
Let's go back to that time
[Refrain: Jin, Jimin]
Baby I know
I can make it better
I can hold you tighter
All those roads
Are pointing to you
Everything was useless
Anything other than you
Just touch me like that time

[Pre-Chorus: Jung Kook, Jin, V, Jimin]
This eternal night with no end in sight
It's you who gifted me the morning
Now can I hold that hand?
Oh oh
I can make it right

[Chorus: Jimin, Jung Kook, V]
All right
All right
Ooh, I can make it right
All right
All right
Ooh, I can make it right

[Bridge: SUGA]
You are still beautiful
Just hold me silently like you did that day, that time
The reason I survived in hell
It's for you, it was not for me
If you know, don't hesitate and please save my life
I'm thirsty wandering this desert without you
So hurry and grab me quickly
I know the sea without you is the same as a desert
[Chorus: Jimin, Jung Kook, V]
All right
I can make it better
I can hold you tighter
Oh I can make it right
Everything was useless
Anything other than you
Oh I can make it right

[Outro: V, Jung Kook]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right

Hey, I've had my eyes on you
We just met but it's been fun, I wanna know more
Hey, don't just laugh (Yuh)
I can take you to a place you've never been before

[Pre-Chorus: Wonwoo, Hoshi]
Come with me
Put it on, put it on me
You got this
Put it on, put it on me
I know you'll take my hand
'Cause I know that you've been dreaming
[Chorus: DK, SeungKwan, Vernon]
Like a déjà vu of heaven
Meet up, let's start your interview
I can give you everything you want
Down to your darkest sides
Come, come into my world

[Post-Chorus: Dino, THE 8]
Won't let you down
Won't let you down
Come to me
In my, in my, in my new world

[Verse 2: Vernon, S.COUPS]
Knock, knock, knockin' on heavеn's door
Run your fingertips over the whippеd cream cloud
Step out my All Stars and fly, sunset
Too fast? I'ma take it slow
Dance like this where there's no sadness
Clap your hands to the beat
Give me your forever, more taste of this bliss
Forever and ever more, more, more, more

[Pre-Chorus: THE 8, Jeonghan]
Come with me
Put it on, put it on me
You got this
Put it on, put it on me
I know you'll take my hand
'Cause I know that you've been dreaming
[Chorus: WOOZI, Joshua, Jeonghan]
Like a déjà vu of heaven
Meet up, let's start your interview
I can give you everything you want
Down to your darkest sides
Come, come into my world

[Post-Chorus: Jun, Dino]
Won't let you down
Won't let you down
Come to me
In my, in my, in my new world

[Bridge: Mingyu, SeungKwan, Joshua]
We got the heart we got the soul
Open our hearts just like this
To you, and you to me
Open up a new future, I won't let go of your hand
Trust in me, baby, I can see

[Chorus: Hoshi, DK, Wonwoo]
Like a déjà vu of heaven
Meet up, let's start your interview
I can give you everything you want
Down to your darkest sides
Come, come into my world
[Post-Chorus: WOOZI, Jun]
Won't let you down
Won't let you down
Come to me
In my, in my, in my new world

All eyes are on us (Us)
Chariot riding across the sun (Keep riding, oh)
Juicy, juicy, uh, juicy, juicy
When the gunshot's all done ringing (That spicy feelin')
Aim and shoot the sun at your heart (I just wanna do this)
Uh, juicy, juicy

[Verse 2: WOOZI, Wonwoo, Jun]
Turn up the music (Ooh-ooh)
Run across the world all fierce (Ooh-ooh)
Sun in tow, step on it
Honk the horn, we be us and fire (We be us)
No need to imitate (No need to imitate)
More, more like how we do it (More, more like how we do it)
Say ah, hot, hot, hot
[Pre-Chorus: DK, Joshua, Dino]
No night just day, the sky scorched red
Like the world's in monochrome (Like it's become one tone)
Deep overwhеlming breaths and super-heatеd rhythm vibe
Wager my road on the sun of fate
Follow me, go

[Chorus: S.COUPS, WOOZI, Jeonghan, Mingyu]
We drop it like hot, hot, hot
Oh, we feelin' so hot
This song is burnin' like hot, hot, hot, hot
(Boom-brr-boom-boom)
We drop it like hot, hot, hot
Oh, we feelin' so hot
Yeah, I'm runnin' too hot, hot, hot, hot
(Boom-brr-boom-boom)

[Post-Chorus: Hoshi, SeungKwan]
Face the sun, set it on fire
So hot
(Boom-brr-boom-boom)
Face the sun, set it on fire
This song is sizzling, everybody join in

[Verse 3: Wonwoo, WOOZI, S.COUPS]
Ayy, blow the horn, drive away through the desert waves
I don't want, uh, one more chance
This moment, I'm goin' all in
Shadow cast with my back to the sun turns to light again
Yeah, heart set on fire, no lie, we sure
[Pre-Chorus: Hoshi, Jun, Dino]
About to burst, I can't breathe
My burning heart (Won't listen to me)
Deep overwhelming breaths and super-heated rhythm vibe
You know what to do
Hey, you know what to do

[Chorus: THE 8, Wonwoo, Vernon, Jeonghan]
We drop it like hot, hot, hot
Oh, we feelin' so hot
The song is burnin' like hot, hot, hot, hot
(Boom-brr-boom-boom)
We drop it like hot, hot, hot
Oh, we feelin' so hot
Yeah, I'm runnin' too hot, hot, hot, hot
(Boom-brr-boom-boom)

[Bridge: Jeonghan, SeungKwan, DK]
Run through the thick forest
Oh, sun atop the deep ocean
We'll go through the fire (Fire)
Jump the limit once more (Beyond)
We'll rise high all of a sudden and become the sun, aw

[Chorus: Mingyu, Jun, Joshua, S.COUPS]
We drop it like hot, hot, hot
Oh, we feelin' so hot
This song burnin' like hot, hot, hot, hot
(Boom-brr-boom-boom)
We drop it like hot, hot, hot (Ooh, woah)
Oh, we feelin' so hot (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I'm runnin' too hot, hot, hot, hot
(Boom-brr-boom-boom)
[Post-Chorus: Dino, Vernon]
