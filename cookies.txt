Almond Biscotti

cookies, deserts

1 cup sugar
1/2 cup butter, sweet; melted
3 tablespoon brandy
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 cup almonds, unsalted; chopped
3  eggs
2 1/2 cup flour
1/2 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt

Preheat oven to 350~.  Mix sugar with butter, brandy, vanilla, almond
extract, nuts and eggs.  Mix well. Stir in flour, baking powder and
salt. Form into a long loaf (or loaves), place on a cookie sheet and
bake for 20-30 minutes or until firm and softly cakelike. Remove from
oven and let cool slightly. When cool enough to handle, slice into
1/2 inch diagonal slices and return to cookie sheet. Bake for 15-25
miutes, turning once, until both sides are brown-flecked and toasted.
Cool thoroughly and store in an airtight jar. Makes 2-3 dozen.
Variation 1 (Mandlebrot): increase sugar to 1-1/4 cups. Diced dried
apricots may by added. Variation 2: for a clasic anise-flavored
biscotto, substitute Pernod, Ouzo or Anisette for the brandy and omit
the almond extract. Several tablespoons of anise seeds may be added
for additional oomph. Variation 3 (Hazelnut biscotti): use hazelnuts
in place of almonds. A hazelnut liqueur may be used instead of
brandy.  Omit the almond extract. Variation 4 (Mediterranean
biscotti): use rosewater instead of brandy. Substitute unsalted
pistachio nuts for the almonds, and add 1/4 - 1/2 cup diced figs to
the dough. Variation 5 (Ginger-flavored biscotti): to the basic
dough, add 1 Tbsp powdered ginger, a generous dash of cloves and
cinnamon, 1 or 2 Tbsp of candied ginger and 1/4 cup raisins, if
desired.  Omit the almond extract. Variation 6 (Paximatha): this
Greek rusk dates back to the 5th century, virtually unchanged.
Substiture 1/2 to 3/4 cup toasted sesame seeds for the almonds. Omit
the almond extact and flavor the dough with 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2
teaspoon cloves. Variation 7 (Fekkas):  a Moroccon twice-baked cookie.
Substitute orange flower water for the brandy. Variation 8; Pine nuts
may be used instead of almonds, though the richness may be less
desirable than the crunch of the toasted almonds. Candied fruits,
too, may be added, 1/4 to 1/2 cup assorted fruits blended into the
dough before baking. Variation 9 (Chocolate Dipped): melt 1/2 pound
semi-sweet chocolate in the top of a double boiler over just
simmering water. If it "seizes" or "tightens", add 2 Tbsp of unsalted
buter and it should smooth out again. Dip only one side of each
cookie (the chocolate won't seal in the moisture that way).

Almond Cookie Shells

cookies, deserts

3 large egg whites
2 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoon flour
1/2 cup almonds, sliced, toasted

Put the egg whites in a bowl and beat them briefly.

Add the sugar and flour, then whisk.  Stir in the almonds.

Butter a sheet pan and spoon tablespoons of mixture onto the pan.
Spread the spoonfuls on the sheet slightly with the back of a spoon
to form circles about 2 inches apart.

Bake in a 350 F oven for 5 - 7 minutes.  Remove from oven and
while still hot, you can mold the cookies into small cups by placing
them over small cups, or shot glasses, or even the back of a muffin
tin. Set aside to dry.

When dry, the almond cookies can be eaten as is, or in my
favorite way which is to fill them with mousse of some kind - or even
ice cream or yogurt (if you eat hurriedly before they soften.) ;-)

Apricot Squares

cookies

2/3 cup dried apricots
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/4 cup sugar
1 1/3 cup flour, divided
1 cup light brown sugar, packed
2  eggs
1/2 cup chopped almonds or walnuts
1/2 teaspoon double-acting baking powder
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 confectioners sugar

You can use either almonds or walnuts in this recipe-each gives a
very different flavor.

In a small saucepan, place apricots and cover with water. Cook,
covered, over low heat for 15 minutes. Drain, and when apricots are
cool enough to handle, chop finely. Set aside.

Preheat oven to 350ø. Grease 8 x 8-inch baking pan. In a large bowl,
beat butter, sugar and 1 cup flour until well mixed and crumbly; pat
into bottom of pan. Bake 20 minutes at 350ø or just until golden.

While batter is in oven, use the same bowl to mix all remaining
ingredients (including apricots) except confectioners sugar. Pour over
baked layer and return to oven for 25 minutes.

Remove from oven; cool in pan before cutting in squares or oblongs
with a sharp knife. Dust with confectioners sugar.

Rich, this is an old favorite of mine, from my great-grandmother.
Thought everyone would enjoy it.  I love them, and so does the rest
of my family. They were always part of Christmas baking for us.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Combine shortening, oats, flour, sugar,
raisins, milk, cinnamon, soda and salt. It should stick together when
you squeeze a small amount in your hand. Drop small amounts on sheet.
Bake 10 minutes.

Hope you try them, they are the best I've ever tasted, though I'm
probably biased.

Butter 2 large baking sheets. Mix flour, sugar, salt and baking soda.
Beat in eggs, then whole and chopped nuts. Mix to obtain a firm
dough. Knead briefly, then divide dough into 4 pieces. On a floured
work surface, roll each piece under your hands into a cylinder 15
inches long and about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Place 2 rolls, well
separated, on each baking sheet and bake 15 to 20 minutes, until very
lightly browned and firm to the touch. With a spatula, carefully
transfer the rolls to a cutting board and slice each one diagonally
into cookies about 1/2-inch thick. Set wire racks on the baking
sheets and lay out the biscotti on them. Return them to the oven for
20 to 30 minutes, or until very firm and crisp. Cool on the racks,
then transfer them to a tin for long keeping. Try adding 1 1/2-to-2
tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder to this recipe for a nice

cookies

1/3 cup shortening
1/3 cup margarine
2 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup sugar
1  egg
1 tablespoon milk
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

In a large bowl, beat the shortening and margarine with an electric
mixer at medium to high spped for about 30 seconds, or until softened.

Add about half of the flour and all of the remaining ingredients and
beat until thoroughly combined, scraping the sides of the bowl
occasionally. Beat or stir in the remaining flour. Divide the dough
in half. Cover and chill for 1 to 2 hours or until easy to handle.

Roll each portion of the dough to 1/8 inch thickness on a lightly
floured surface.  Cut into the desired shapes. Place 1 inch apart on
an ungreased cookie sheet. If desired, sprinkle with candies or
colord sugar before baking.

Bake in a 375 F oven for 7 to 9 minutes or until the edges are firm
and the bottoms are very lightly browned. Remove the cookies and cool
on a rack.

Makes 3 to 4 dozen cookies.

CHOCOLATE SUGAR COOKIES:  Stir 1 tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa
powder into one half of the recipe. Bake as directed.

NOTE: Sugar cookies also make attractive and economical ornaments.
Make the dough according to the recipe then flatten the cut out
cookies slightly with the bottom of a small glass dipped in sugar.
Use a drinking straw to make a sharp, small hole near the top. If the
hole begins to close during baking, use the straw to re-form the hole.

Benne (Sesame Seed) Cookies

cookies

1 cup benne (sesame) seeds
1 1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup butter or margarine, melted
1  egg
1 teaspoon vanilla

Known as sesame seeds in most of the country, "benne" is the name
southerners learned to call these seeds, which were brought from
Africa by slaves. Toasting benne seeds develop their flavor and also
gives these cookies a slightly crunchy texture.

Heat oven to 375ø. Toast benne seeds on ungreased baking sheet until
light brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Watch closely so they don't burn.

In a large bowl, mix all ingredients. Drop dough by 1/2 teaspoonfuls
1 1/2 inches apart onto greased baking sheet. Bake at 375ø until
light brown, about 4-6 minutes. Cool about 2 minutes before removing
from baking sheets to wire rack to cool completely. Store in tightly
covered cookie tin when thoroughly cooled.

BEST: OATMEAL COOKIE MIX

cookies, mix

4 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
4 1/2 cup quick-cooking rolled oats
4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 tablespoon baking soda
2 teaspoon salt

In large bowl, stir together flour, rolled oats, sugar, baking powder,
baking soda and salt. Transfer to airtight container; store in cool,
dry place for up to 2 months.

Stir well before using.

Cookie Tips:

1. Refrigerate the spoonfuls of dough on baking sheet for 15 minutes
before baking to produce thick cookies.

2. Check cookies at the minimum baking time since baking times can
only be approximate. It's no problem to bake a sheet of cookies for
another minute or so.

3. Store in airtight container (tin, glass or plastic); cover with
plastic wrap before closing with tight lids.

BIG COOKIE - WW - #2

cookies, deserts, diabetic, bananas

1 1/2 ounce oatmeal; dry
1/3 cup nonfat dry milk
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon cinnamon
2 tablespoon raisins
2 tablespoon peanut butter; (chunky)
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2  banana; (mashed)(adds sweet)
2 tablespoon water; (maybe 3 t)

Combine all. Divide into 2 cookies on a sprayed baking sheet. Bake at
350 F. for 5-8 min. Do not over-bake. This makes 2 soft cookies. 1
cookie = 1 bread, 1/2 milk, 1 protein, 1 fat and 1 fruit.

Big White Soft Sugar Cookies

cookies

1 cup buttermilk
1 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup vegetable oil
3 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/2 cup sugar
3 cup unbleached flour
2  eggs
1  sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon salt

Seedless raisins

In a measuring cup, mix the buttermilk and baking soda; set aside. In
a large mixer bowl, combine the oil, sugar, and eggs; mix well. Add
the buttermilk-soda mixture and blend.  Then add the salt, nutmeg,
vanilla, and baking powder and mix again. Blend in the flour (the
batter will be very runny). Cover and refrigerate overnight. The next
day, preheat oven to 400 F.  For the very best results, use ungreased
non-stick baking sheets. Dark or shiny sheets conduct the heat
differently, and the cookie will have crisp brown edges, which are
just what you don't want. Use 1 heaping tablespoon of batter per
cookie, and place them on the sheets. Liberally sprinkle more sugar
on top of each cookie and dot with 3 raisins. Keep batter
refrigerated between bakings. Bake for just 5 minutes. The cookies
should be just barely done--still almost white. If they are golden,
you have left them in too long.  Remove from oven, and allow the
cookies to remain on the cookie sheet for 3 more minutes to continue
baking. Carefully remove cookies with a metal spatula to a wax
paper-covered rack to cool. The cookies keep well in tightly covered
containers or can be frozen. In either case, each cookie should be
wrapped individually or between layers of wax paper.  They are so
tender, so moist, so cakelike that they cling together if this is not
done.

Birds In The Nest

cookies

1 cup brown sugar
1 cup butter or shortening
2  eggs, separated
2 tablespoon water
2 cup unsifted flour
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup ground nuts
1 jelly-your favorite flavor

These cookies have been a "must" on my family's holiday table since
I was a little girl. My earliest memories of "birds in the nest" take
me back to my maternal grandmother's house where she filled each
"nest" according to the favorite jelly flavor of each of her
grandchildren.

In a large bowl, cream the sugar and butter or shortening. Add egg
yolks, water, flour, vanilla and salt. Mix well and compress into a
ball.

Preheat oven to 350ø.

Break pieces off to form small, walnut-size balls. Dip each ball in
unbeaten egg whites, then roll in ground nuts. Slightly flatten ball
to form disk, then press finger in center to form a small well. Fill
the well with a drop of jelly. (Don't put in to much or it will melt
over the side of the cookie.)

Bake at 350ø for 15-20 minutes on a greased cookie sheet Remove from
oven and cool cookies on wire racks.

Biscotti All'anice

cookies, italian

3  eggs
2 teaspoon anise extract
3/4 cup sugar
1 pinch salt
1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon baking powder

PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Combine the eggs, extract, sugar and salt in a
mixing bowl or the bowl of an electric mixer and whip with a hand
mixer set at high speed or in a heavy duty mixer fitted with the
whip. Continue whipping until the mixture is very light and increased
in volume, 6-7 minutes. While the egg mixture is whipping, combine
the flour, cornstarch and baking powder and stir to mix. Remove the
whipped eggs from the mixer and sift over the flour mixture in three
additions, folding it in after each addition with a rubber spatula.
The batter will lose most of its air and become rather stiff. Pipe
the batter, using a pastry bag with a 3/4-inch opening, but no tube,
onto a jelly roll pan lined with parchment paper or buttered wax
paper. Pipe two logs about 1 1/2 inches wide and the length of the
pan. Bake the logs about 20 minutes, until they are well risen and
golden. Remove from oven and place logs on a cutting board to cool
about 10 minutes. Using a sharp, serrated knife, slice the logs
diagonally at 1/2-inch intervals. Place the biscotti cut side down on
the pan and return them to the oven for about 10-15 minutes, until
they color lightly on the cut surfaces. Cool the biscotti on the pans
and store them in a tin between layers of wax paper.

Biscotti Del Laggaccio

cookies

      ----FOR THE SPONGE----
1 pkg active dry yeast; 2 1/2 tsp warm water
3/4 cup flour; all purpose,
1  unbleached
      ----FOR THE DOUGH----
1/2 cup sugar water and water
1/4 cup butter; unsalted, 1/2 stick cut
2 1/2 cup flour; all purpose,
1  unbleached
1 tablespoon aniseed salt

"Did Columbus and his crews sail to the new world eating these
traditional Ligurian biscotti? It's entirely possible, although
theirs would have been cooked much longer to drive off all the
moisture, allowing them to keep for an entire ocean crossing. Though
these biscotti are made with an enriched bread dough instead of the
traditional cookie dough and have a somewhat softer texture, they
keep well when stored in an airtight container."

Make the sponge: In the bowl of an electric mixer proof the yeast in
the water for 5 minutes, or until the mixture is foamy. Whisk in the
flour and let the sponge stand, covered with plastic wrap, for 30
minutes or until it is foamy.
To the sponge, add the sugar, the water and the butter and stir the
mixture until it is combined well. Add the flour, the aniseed, and
the salt and with the electric mixer fitted with the dough hook knead
the dough for 3 minutes, or until it is smooth but still sticky.
Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, turning it to coat it

Biscotti Di Consuolo (Consolation Biscuits)

cookies, deserts, ethnic

2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 large egg
1/2 cup honey
1/4 cup mild olive oil; or melted butter

Although these biscuits have an unhappy association, they are tender
and tasty. The name refers to the time during which a bereaved family
receives callers and serves them these biscotti with a glass of wine.
In Campania and the Basilicata, these customs survive in
out-of-the-way mountain villages that still cling to ancient
traditions.

Combine the flour, salt, and baking powder in a mixing bowl. Combine
the egg, honey and olive oil or butter in a bowl, beat to mix, and
pour into the flour mixture. Stir well to form a firm dough. Remove
the dough from the bowl to a floured surface and knead well, about 2
or 3 minutes. Flour the dough lightly, wrap in plastic, and allow to
rest at room temperature about 1 hour. Unwrap the dough, cut it into
12 pieces, and roll each piece into a rope about 1/4 inch in diameter
x 12 inches long. Divide each rope into three pieces. Join the ends
and form each piece into a figure eight, making sure that the seam
lies at the midpoint of the figure eight and underneath it.
Transfer the biscotti to parchment lined cookie sheets and bake them
in a preheated 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes, until puffed and
light golden.

Cool the biscotti on a rack and store in a tin between sheets of wax
paper. Makes 3 dozen.

Biscotti Di Prato (Little Almond Cookies)

cookies, deserts, italian

2 ounce almonds, blanched
6 ounce almonds, unblanched
4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 3/4 cup granulated sugar
3 extra-large eggs
1 pinch salt
1 pinch ground saffron
1 teaspoon (scant) baking soda
1 extra-large egg white

Preheat the oven to 375F.  Place both the blanched and unblanched
almonds on a cookie sheet and toast in the preheated oven for 15
minutes, until golden brown. Grind 4 ounces of mixed blanched and
unblanched almonds very fine, then cut the remaining toasted almonds
into two or three pieces each. Place the flour on a pasta board in a
mound and make a well in the center. Put the sugar and eggs in the
well. Mix the sugar and eggs together well, then add the salt,
saffron, and baking soda. Mix thoroughly and when all the ingredients
in the well are well integrated, incorporate the flour little by
little, until all but about 2 tablespoons is incorporated. Set the
leftover flour aside. Knead the dough for 10 to 15 minutes, then add
the very finely ground almonds and the almond pieces. Knead for 2 to
3 minutes more, incorporating the remaining flour. Divide the dough
into 8 pieces.  With your hands, shape each piece into a long, thin
roll about 3/4 inch in diameter, then place, widely apart on a
buttered and floured cookie sheet.  Beat the egg white slightly in a
small bowl and lightly coat the tops of the 8 rolls with it, using a
pastry brush, then put the baking sheet into the preheated oven for
18 to 20 minutes. Remove the rolls from the oven (they will expand in
size sideways) and cut them with a long slicing knife at a 45-degree
angle every 3/4 inch to get the shape required for this type of
little cookie, or biscotti. Place the biscotti back in the oven, this
time at 275F, for 35 to 45 minutes. They will be very dry. NOTE:
These cookies are much better eaten after 2 or 3 days, when they have
softened a little; keep them in a paper bag. If you wish to keep them
indefinitely, transfer after a week to a jar or can. Serves 8 to 10.

Blind Date Cookies

cookies

30 large pitted dates
30 large walnuts, halves
1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
4 tablespoon butter
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup light brown sugar, firmly packed
1  egg
1/2 cup sour cream
1  glaze:
4 tablespoon butter
1 cup confectioner's sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoon milk, up to 3 teaspoon

Adjust a rack to the top position in the oven and preheat the oven to
400. Cut parchement to fit cookie sheets. Slit one long side of each
date, stuff with one walnut half or a few pieces of walnut. Close the
date around the nut and set aside.

Sift together the flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda and set
aside. Cream the butter, add the vanilla and the sugar and beat to
mix well. Add the egg and beat thouroughly. On the lowest speed
gradually add half the dry ingredients, then all of the sour cream,
then the remaining dry ingredients. Scrape the bowl after each
addition and beat only until combined. Transfer the dough to a
shallow bowl for easier handling.

Using two forks, drop each stuffed date into the the dough and roll it
around until it is completely coated. There will be enough dough to
cover each date, but don't overdo it or you won't have enough to go
around. Using the forks, place the dough coated dates 2-3 inches
apart on the prepared cookie sheets.

Bake one sheet at a time for about 10 minutes until lightly browned.

While baking, prepare the glaze. Melt the butter and mix it well with
the remaining ingredients, using only enough milk to make the mixture
the consistency of soft mayonnaise. Keep the glaze covered when you
are not using it.

Remove the cookies form the oven. With a pastry brush, immediatley
brush the tops with a generous coating of the glaze. Transfer cookies
to a rack to cool. Let them stand until the glaze is dry. NOTES
: The dates I purchased from the Coop were huge. We cut the date in
half and stuffed them with walnut pieces.  These aren't the most
beautiful cookies but boy are they good.

Bone A Fidos

cookies, christmas

2 1/4 teaspoon dry yeast (or 1 packed
1 tablespoon compressed fresh
1  yeast
1/4 cup (liquid measur warm water
1 pinch of sugar
3 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 cup whole wheat flour
2 cup cracked wheat or
1 cup cornmeal
1 cup rye flour
1/2 cup nonfat dry milk (lightly
1 spooned into the cup)
4 teaspoon kelp powder
4 cup beef or chicken broth
1 (liquid measure)
      ----GLAZE----
1 large egg
2 tablespoon milk

Equipment: Cookie sheets lined with parchment or aluminum foil;
rolling pin; 3-31/2" bone cutter or 2 1/2" round cookie cutter.

Place 2 oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven. Preheat
oven to 300F.

Sprinkle the dry yeast or crumple the compressed yeast over the water
(110F if dry yeast, 100F if compressed yeast). Add a pinch of sugar
and allow the yeast to sit in a draft-free spot for 10-20 minutes.
The mixture should be full of bubbles.  If not, the yeast is too old
to be useful.

In a large bowl, place all the dry ingredients and stir to blend
them. Add the yeast mixture and 3 cups of the broth. Using your
hands, in the bowl, mix to form the dough, adding more broth if
needed to make the dough smooth and supple.  Half a batch at a time,
knead the dough briefly on a lightly floured counter. (Keep the
second batch of dough covered with a moist towel while shaping and
cutting the first.)

Roll out the dough into an 18 x 13 x 1/4" rectangle. Cut it into
desired shapes, using a 3 - 3 1/2-inch bone cutter or a 2 1/2-inch
round cookie cutter. Reroll the scraps. Repeat the procedure with the
remaining dough.

For an attractive shine, lightly beat together the egg and milk.
Brush the glaze on the cookies.

Bake for 45 to 60 minutes or until brown and firm. For even baking,
rotate the cookie sheets from top to bottom three quarters of the way
through the baking period.

Use a small, angled metal spatula or pancake turner to transfer the
cookies to wire racks to cool completely.

Store in an airtight container at room temperature. The dough must be
used immediately.  The baked cookies will keep for many months.

Allow cookie sheets to cool completely between batches.

Butter Cookies

cookies

1/2 cup butter (unsalted), at room temperat; ure
1/2 cup sugar, granulated
1 1/2 cup flour, white
1 large egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder

Beat the butter with the sugar.  Add the egg and vanilla and beat until you
get a uniform mixture.  Mix the flour and baking powder and gradually blend
them into the mixture.  When you're done, you should have a rather sticky
dough.

Shape the dough into balls, about 1 inch in diameter.  Roll them in sugar
and place them on an ungreased cookie sheet, leaving about an inch of space
between cookies, so that they don't stick together when they expand.

Bake in preheated oven at 350 degrees F. for 20 minutes.  Remove from oven,
let them cool for a while, and start eating right away.

NOTES:

*  After reading the ingredients on a can of imported Danish butter
cookies, I thought: "Hey! I can do this myself!", so I developed the
following recipe. It doesn't resemble the original too much, but
considering that the cookies don't stay around for more than two days, and
that even my mother liked them, they must be good! Yield: Makes 2-3 dozen
cookies.

: Difficulty:  Easy.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, 20 minutes baking.

Butterscotch Brownies

1 cup butter, melted
2 cup light brown sugar
3  eggs
2 teaspoon vanilla
2 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup chopped walnuts, pecans, etc
      ----FROSTING----
1/2 cup butter
3 cup sifted confectioners sugar
2 teaspoon instant coffee*

* dissolved in 2 Tablespoons hot water

These chewy squares ooze brown sugary butterscotch. They becrumb the
lips and besmear the chin, like home-baked goodies should.

Preheat oven to 350ø.

Melt butter in a large saucepan. Add sugar and beat well to mix.
Cool the mixture slightly, then beat in the eggs and vanilla.

Sift together flour, salt and baking powder. Stir it into the wet
ingredients, then add the nuts. Mix well. Spread brownies in a
greased 11 x 7 x 2-inch pan and bake at 350ø for 30 to 35 minutes or
until a light gold. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out.
This is easiest if you up-end the pan over waxed paper, then turn the
cake right side up. Let it finish cooling on a rack.

To make the frosting, cream 1/2 cup butter with confectioners sugar.
Beat it until light, then beat in the coffee mixture. Spread over the
brownies. When frosting has set, cut in squares.

cookies, christmas

      ----COOKIES----
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter, softened
1  egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 3/4 cup flour, sifted
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
      ----GLAZE----
1 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar
1  egg white, slightly beaten
1 tablespoon butter, melted
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1  food coloring (optional)

Mix sugar, salt and butter thoroughly.  Add egg and vanilla and beat till
fluffy.

Sift flour, baking powder, soda and cinnamon and add to mixture. Chill
well, several hours, or overnight.

MAKE THE GLAZE:  Mix the glaze ingredients together until smooth.

Roll the dough out until it is about 1/8 inch thick.  Cut into fancy shapes
and bake on ungreased cookie sheet for 8-10 minutes at 350 degrees F. Let
cool and glaze.

NOTES:

*  Rolled cookies for the Christmas holidays -- I almost never make these
cookies except at Christmas time.  They just seem to be Christmas cookies.
(I did make a batch of heart shaped ones last Valentine's day for my
then-fiance.)  I usually make these cookies in  Christmas shapes and frost
them with green and red frosting.  This is a good recipe for kids to help
out with.

*  It helps to keep most of the dough in the refrigerator while you are
cutting shapes.  It cuts much better when it is cold.

*  These are time-consuming and fairly difficult, but worth it.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, overnight chill, 1 hour cutting and
baking.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.

resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the nuts. Combine the egg and milk.
Stir into the flour mixture just til moistened. On a lightly floured
surface, pat dough into a 10 x 7" rectangle.  Cut crosswise into 1"
wide strips. Twist each strip by holding both ends. Bend 1 end to
form candy cane shape. Place candy canes several inches apart on

Candy Cane Cookies

cookies, deserts

2 cup butter
1 1/2 cup sugar
4 single egg yolks
2 teaspoon vanilla
4 1/2 cup unbleached flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon peppermint candy
1  red food colouring

Cream together butter and sugar.  Add egg yolks and vanilla and mix
well. Sift flour and salt together and beat into butter mixture until
well mixed. When ready, divide dough in half.  To one half, add 1/2
ts. red food colouring.  Using about a tablespoon of dough, roll a 4"
strip of each colour (no fatter than a pencil). Place the two
coloured rolls side-by-side and press lightly together.  Gently twist
like a rope and place on an ungreased cookie sheet 1" apart. Curve
the top like a candy cane and bake in a pre-heated oven at 350 F. for
about 15 minutes; do not brown. Sprinkle with crushed peppermint
candy before cool. Makes 20-30 medium cookies. Personal Note:  After
trial and error, I found that it is easier to take each tablespoon of
cookie dough and roll in hands to form rough cylinder. Then put on
flat surface vertically. Using fingers and palm in same direction,
gently roll left and right until the size of a pencil. (the dough,
that is):)  Pick a time to do these cookies when you're feeling
creative and have patience. It's fun and they are yummy! The end
product is worth the trouble.

*To toast and skin hazelnuts, put in one layer in preheated 350F oven
for 10 to 15 minutes or until they are colored lightly and skins
blistered. Wrap the nuts in a kitchen towel and let them steam for 1

a dough is formed, and stir in the hazelnuts and chocolate chips.
Turn out the dough onto a floured surface, knead it several times
and halve it. Working on a large buttered and floured baking sheet,
with floured hands, form each piece of dough into a flattish log 12
inches long by 2 inches wide and arrange the logs at least 3 inches
apart on the sheet.
Bake the logs in the middle of a preheated 350F oven for 35 minutes
and let them cool on the baking sheet on a rack for about 10 minutes.
Reduce the oven temperature to 300F. On a cutting board, cut the logs
crosswise on the diagonal into 3/4 inch slices , arrange the
biscotti, cut sides down, on the baking sheet, and bake them for 5 to
6 minutes on each side, or until they are pale golden. Transfer the

*NOTE: "puffy pastel things are to look like the cat ate styrofoam
packing pellets-i haven't tried this TO MAKE: icrowave the honey till
it bubbles(about 1 minute). add the butter,(i've been told using lard
makes for a more realistic texture and softer cookie) and the
molasses, if any. add the egg, mix well, then mix in all the other
stuff. add mix-ins of your choice to some or all of the batter. Chill
1 hour in the freezer or several hours in the fridge. roll dough logs
of random length and the diameter of cat poops. roll logs in grape-
nuts and bake at 350 degrees till done(maybe 10 to 15 minutes but
with my flaky oven you never know). Serve in a disposable cat litter
box on a bed of grapenuts, with a cat litter scoop. i hear you get
lovely effects by decorating the box and scoop with melted chocolate
or pudding.  i imagine brown sugar might work as a substitute for the
new clumping litters, but i havent tried it. this recipe worked
especially well at the halloween party where the table was already
decorated with plastic flies.

Chocoholics Cookies

4 ounce unsweetened chocolate
12 ounce semi-sweet chocolate
3 ounce unsalted butter
3 ounce margarine
1 1/2 tablespoon instant espresso

1 1/2 cup sugar
4 tablespoon vanilla
3 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
6 ounce semi-sweet chocolate
8 ounce pecan halves
8 ounce walnut halves
6 ounce semi-sweet chocolate, melted

in oven until toasted, 10 to 12 minutes or until they develop a toasty
aroma.  Remove from oven and set aside to cool. Increase oven
temperature to 350 degrees. Place unsweetened chocolate, 12 ounce
semi-sweet chocolate, butter, margarine and espresso in top of double
boiler and place over simmering (not boiling) water until chocolate
is about 3/4 melted. Meanwhile, beat the eggs with a wire whisk in a
large mixing bowl. Gradually add sugar, whisking until mixture
becomes thick and light in color.  When chocolate is almost melted,
remove from heat and stir until completely melted and satiny in
appearance.
Gradually whisk chocolate into egg mixture.  Stir with a wooden
spoon to incorporate.  Sift flour, baking powder and salt directly
into chocolate mixture.  Gently stir until the dry ingredients are
barely incorporated. Cut the 6 ounce of semi-sweet chocolate into 1/2
inch chunks and stir into dough along with the toasted nuts. Lightly
butter 4 aluminum baking sheets. (do not use foil or cookies will
burn) Drop dough by tablespoonfuls, 12 to a sheet to leave room for
cookies to spread. Bake only one sheet at a time in center of oven.
Bake at 350 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes, or until cookies lose their
shine. Cookies will still be very soft. Allow to cool for 2 minutes
before removing from pans.
Using a pin-sized tip on an icing bag, pipe melted semi-sweet
chocolate onto cookies in a criss-cross pattern. Allow to cool at
least 1 hour before storing in tins. Makes 50 one-ounce cookies

Christmas Angel Cookies

cookies

1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup cream cheese, softened
1 cup light brown sugar,*
1/2 cup granulated sugar
2  eggs
3 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon vanilla
2 cup candied fruit, mixed
2 cup broken pecans or almonds

* firmly packed

The cream cheese gives these cookies a smooth texture, while the
fruits sparkle and sweeten the flavor. Nice for using the candied
fruits that didn't make it into the fruit cake.

Preheat oven to 350ø.

In a large bowl, cream shortening and cream cheese until smooth and
fluffy. Add sugars and eggs, mixing well. In a seperate bowl, sift
flour, baking soda and salt together.

Add flour mixture to egg and sugar mixture; add vanilla. Mix well.
Add candied fruit and nuts.

Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto lightly oiled cookie sheet and bake
at 350ø for about 10-12 minutes. The cookies will be just browned at
the edges.

Hint: You may have to mix candied fruit and nuts in with your hands; a
little shortening on your fingers will keep the mixture from sticking.

Christmas Ornament Cookies - Country Living

cookies, christmas

1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, softened
1/4 cup vegetable shortening
1 1/3 cup sugar
2 large eggs
3 1/2 cup unsifted all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1  royal icing-recipe follows
1  food coloring (see note)

1.  In large bowl, with electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter
and shortening until well blended; add sugar and beat until light.
Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.

2.  In medium-size bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt. With
mixer on low speed, add half of flour mixture to butter mixture and
beat until soft dough forms. Shape dough into 3 equal balls; wrap and
refrigerate at least 30 minutes.

3.  To cut and bake cookies: Heat oven to 350F. Lightly grease 2
baking sheets.  Cut 2 pieces of waxed paper the same size as the
baking sheets. Lightly flour waxed paper and roll out one ball of
dough between paper to 1/8-inch thickness.  Remove top piece of waxed
paper. Using our 7-inch bauble-shaped cookie cutter, cut out as many
baubles from dough as possible, leaving 1/2 inch between each shape.
Remove all trimmings and press together.  Invert waxed paper with
baubles onto greased baking sheet and peel off waxed paper. Reroll
trimmings between waxed paper and repeat cutting and inverting
baubles to fill second baking sheet. If making cookies for ornaments,
use a toothpick tp pierce a small hole about 1/2 inch from top of
each cookie.

4.  Bake cookies 8 to 10 minutes or until golden. Cool 5 minutes on
baking sheets, then remove to wire racks and cool completely before
decorating. Repeat rolling, cutting, and baking with remaining balls
of dough and trimmings.

5.  To decorate cookies as pictured in the magazine (plaid), prepare
Royal Icing.  Divide icing in half, placing one half in a medium-size
bowl. Divide remaining half of icing among 3 small bowls or cups.
Tint icing in medium-size bowl pale yellow with yellow food coloring
(see Note). Mix one small bowl of icing with burgundy food coloring,
another with teal food coloring, and the last bowl with violet food
coloring. Spoon icings (except yellow) into separate small pastry
bags fitted with small (#1) writing tips.  With pastry brush, paint
the front of each cookie with a think coat of the yellow icing, being
sure not to cover pierced hole; let dry and paint again.  When yellow
icing has dried, pipe decorateive lines, dots and curls on front of
cookies using other colored icings. To store cookies, place them in a
single layer in airtight containers.

ROYAL ICING: In large bowl, with electric mixer on low speed, beat
two 1-pound packages confectioners' sugar, 6 large egg whites (if
cookies will be eaten, use meringue powder and follw package
instructions for Royal Icing: see Note), and 1 teaspoon cream of
tartar until mixed. Increase speed to high, beat until very thick and
fluffy-about 6 minutes. Cover tightly with plastic wrap to prevent
drying until ready to use. Makes 4 cups.

Note: We used Wilton's Egg Yellow, Burgundy, Teal and Grape Violet
food coloring and meringue powder, which can be purchased wherever
cake decorating supplies are sold or by calling Wilton Industries at
(800) 772-7771.

      ----COOKIES----
1 cup solid shortening (not butter)
2/3 cup granulated sugar
2  eggs
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 teaspoon almond flavoring
2 3/4 cup flour
      ----FROSTING----
1 1/2 cup powdered sugar
2 tablespoon cream or milk
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla (not mexican, unless you li; ke tan frosting)
1  food coloring

Cream together the shortening and sugar.  Beat in the eggs, salt and
flavorings.  Stir in the flour until blended.  Chill in the refrigerator
for an hour or two.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Roll out on a floured surface to a
thickness of about 1/8 to 1/4 inch. Cut with the cookie cutters of your
choice (this was always a cause for argument in our family). Bake on
ungreased cookie sheets until tan around the edges, about 8-10 minutes.
Allow to cool.

Make the frosting by beating together the sugar, milk and vanilla until
smooth.  Divide and color each portion.  Frost the cookies.

NOTES:

*  Frosted cookie-cutter cookies -- My mom got this recipe many years ago
in a cookbook that came in installments, so it didn't have a name on the
binder and I don't know what it was called. She had us (the kids) make
these cookies every year. Yield: 2-4 dozen.

*  These cookies are about the only ones I know that taste better cooked
and cold than as raw dough.

*  Cinnamon red hots make good eyes for animals or Santas.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.

Cinda (And Whoever Else's) Peanut Butter Cook

1 cup peanut butter
1 cup white or (firmly packed)
1  brown sugar
1  egg
1  bag hershey's kisses, opt'l

(the brown sugar version is best, IMHO)

Since you like peanut butter and chocolate, here's one for you that
shouldn't challenge your abilities too much. The original recipe for
this came from my sister-in-law (the overworked mother of 5 boys) who
got it from a neighbor when she lived in Alaska. Another version was
posted here a couple of years ago by someone (can't recall who), and
I've posted it several times since, but just in case you missed it....

Mix the peanut butter, sugar and egg together.  Roll into balls the
size of large marbles, place on a cookie sheet, and either flatten
with a fork or flatten by pressing a kiss in the center.

Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven until the edges just start to
brown.

NOTE:  This is NOT a misprint.  There is NO FLOUR or anything else in
this recipe, just the peanut butter, egg and sugar. It seems as if it
would be a dreadful mess, but the result is a very good cookie.

Cinnamon Shortbreads

cookies, holiday

100 gm plain wholewheat flour
100 gm plain white flour
50 gm cornflour
50 gm semolina or ground rice
2 teaspoon cinnamon (or more)
225 gm soft butter or margarine
100 gm caster sugar

Set the oven to 170 C (325 F, Gas Mark 3) and grease a 19 cm x 29 cm
(7-1/2 inch x 11-1/2 inch) shallow tin with butter.

Sift the flours, semolina or ground rice and cinnamon into a large
bowl or food processor, adding the residue of bran from the sieve.
Then put in the butter or margarine and the sugar. Whizz, or beat,
all the ingredients together until they form a soft dough which
leaves the sides of the bowl clean.

Press this into the tin, leveling the surface by pressing with the
back of a metal spoon.  Then prick the surface all over with a fork.
Bake for about 45 minutes, until the shortbread is set and quite
crispy on top and very lightly tinged with gold.  It's more tricky to
tell when these are done than with normal shortbreads because they
are already rather brown! If you are in doubt, you can lift up one of
the end pieces and look underneath it to see if it looks done
underneath. If not, carefully put it back and let the shortbread cook
for a bit longer. When it's done, cut it into sections, if you
haven't already done so, and leave it to cool and crisp up in the tin.

This shortbread keeps well in a tin for several days, if it gets the
chance, and also freezes well.  It defrosts very quickly; you can use
it almost straight from the freezer.

Cinnamon Stars

cookies

1 1/4 cup flour
1 cup sugar
1 cup ground walnuts
2  egg yolks
1  grated rind of 1/2 lemon
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
10 tablespoon sweet butter
      ----ICING----
1 1/2 cup confectioners sugar
1  egg white
2 tablespoon lemon juice
2 drop yellow food coloring (opt.)

A must on your Christmas cookie tray. Despite the lemony frosting,
the cinnamon flavor comes through.

On a pastry board, mix flour, sugar and walnuts. Form a mound, make
a well and add the egg yolks, lemon rind and spices. Cut the butter
in small pieces and add to the flour mixture. Knead thoroughly to
make a smooth dough.

Let dough rest for 30 minutes in the refrigerator.

Preheat oven to 350ø. Roll dough out with a rolling pin to 1/8- inch
thick and cut into star shapes with a cookie cutter. Bake at 350ø
until cookies are lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Let cool and
decorate with the icing.

To make icing, mix sugar, egg white, lemon juice and yellow food
coloring (if using) in a bowl until very smooth. (Icing has to be
thick enough so it will not run off stars.) Spread evenly with a
pointed knife on the stars. Let icing dry overnight. Store in a
cookie tin.

Note: If you like a less sweet cookie, omit the icing.

Cinnamon-Raisin Biscotti

cookies

6  eggwhites
1 tablespoon vanilla
1 cup sugar
2 cup flour
2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup raisins

Variations:

for Almond-Cocoa Biscotti: (omit cinnamon and raisins) add 3/4cup
slivered, toasted almonds, 2t almond extract and 1/3 cup cocoa

for Orange-Pistascio Biscotti: (omit cinnamon and raisins) add 3/4cup
toasted pistaccio nuts, 1T orange zest, 2T orange juice conc (the
frozen stuff), and you may need a little extra flour.

Beat egg whites and extracts (and orange juice, if using) together
well. Combine all the dry ingred. and add to the egg and mix well.
Fold in the raisins or nuts. The dough should be firm, but not too
stiff. You may need to add as much as 1/4cup more flour if your egg
whites were large or you are using the orange juice.

Divide the dough in half and shape each into a 'log' about 2" wide and
10"long.  Place each on a greased cookie sheet and bake in a
preheated oven at 325F for 25-30 min.

They should be firm to the touch, but not too brown. Remove from the
oven and turn down the temp to 250F.

Slice each olg into 20-24 pieces and place upright (if you can balance
them!) on the cookie sheets. Return to the oven for about 30-40 min.
The thicker the slices, the longer it takes, but they should not
brown too much more.  Cool them COMPLETELY before storing them in an
airtight container.

The cinnamon/raisin ones have only a trace of fat per cookie and the
ones with nuts have 1.5g fat per cookie.

These are VERY crunchie and you really do need some tea or a nice skim
capiccino to dunk them in! Submitted By RHOMMEL

Coconut Joys

cookies, holiday

1/4 pound butter (or margarine)
3 cup coconut (one standard package)
2 cup powdered sugar
2 ounce chocolate (unsweetened), melted (2; squares)

Melt butter in a sauce pan.  Remove from heat.  Add powdered sugar and
coconut.  Mix well.

Shape rounded teaspoons of mixture into balls.  Make an indent in
center of each and place on cookie sheet. Fill centers with melted
chocolate. Chill until firm. Store in refrigerator.

NOTES:

*  Super-sweet, super-rich holiday cookies -- This is an easy recipe
that can knock your socks off for flavor and sweetness. In other
words, it will make your teeth fall out.

*  We use sweetened coconut and also use semi-sweet chocolate. This
is why they make your teeth fall out.

*  I tried an approach of melting the stick of margarine using the
microwave on full for 48 seconds. While it was melting, I measured and
mixed up the dry ingredients. I then poured half the liquid over the
premixed coconut-sugar mixture; mixed some and poured in the
remainder. This worked well for me, but my wife insists that the
listed method is easier.

*  Your clean thumb is the best way to make the indentations.

*  Be sure to keep them in the refrigerator until ready to serve.

Coconut Meringue Drops

cookies, holiday

3  egg whites
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup coconut, shredded
1  almonds, whole, unblanched (optiona; l)

Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.  In large bowl use an electric mixer to beat
the egg whites until stiff peaks form.  Gradually beat in sugar. Add
vanilla. With a rubber spatula gently fold in coconut.

Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto greased, floured cookie sheets. Press an
almond in center of each cookie.  Bake at 300 degrees F. for 20 to 25
minutes. Remove to racks to cool.

NOTES:

*  Holiday cookies -- Coconut and almonds give this cookie a distinctive
flavor.  For me the almonds are required.

*  It is a lot of work to beat the egg whites enough without an electric
mixer.

*  This cookie must be handled a little more carefully than most as it
forms a white shell which causes it to be slightly delicate.

These cookies turned out better when I used half the butter and
replaced the other half with applesauce. They weren't quite so thin,
either way though, they were delicious. Walt MM

Coconut-Almond Macaroons

cookies, deserts

      ----ALMOND PASTE----
20 ounce almonds, blanched (can use whole or; pieces)
3 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar
3 large egg whites, lightly beaten
      ----COOKIES----
1 1/2 cup sugar
1 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar
1 pkg coconut, sweetened (large)
1 single almond paste, broken into chunks
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1  salt
6 large egg whites

PREPARE ALMOND PASTE:  Process almonds in food processer until finely
chopped, almost almond butter. Add confectioners' sugar and process
till smooth.  Add egg whites.

Mixture should become very stiff and form a ball in the machine. If
you cannot get it to become evenly moistened, take the mixture out
and knead it on a board "floured" with confectioners' sugar. Divide
the well-blended paste into three equal batches.  (Can wrap well at
this point to refrigerate, up to a week.)

MAKE MACAROONS:  Make this recipe in a food processor in three
batches. For each batch use 1/2 Cup each granulated and
confectioner's sugar, 1/3 of the coconut and almond paste, 1/8 teaspoon
salt, 1 teaspoon vanilla and
2    egg whites.

In processor bowl, combine granulated sugar and coconut. Process
about 2 minutes or until the coconut is finely ground. Add the
confectioners' sugar and the almond paste. Process until the mixture
resembles cornmeal. With the machine running, add the salt, vanilla
and egg whites. Process until the mixture is evenly moistened.

Drop mixture by teaspoonsful onto a cookie sheet covered with brown
paper. Bake at 325 degrees F. for 15-20 minutes, or until the
macaroons are lightly browned. Remove from oven and place brown paper
on a damp towel. When cookies are slightly cooled, use a spatula to
remove them; place them in an air-tight container so they will remain
chewy. Makes 3 to 4 dozen small cookies or 18 large ones.

Coffee Meringue Kisses

cookies, christmas

3/4 cup sugar
3 teaspoon powdered instant coffee
4  egg whites, room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar

These cookies - said to have been a favorite with Marie Antoinette -
are 100 percent fat-free, and have about 20 calories per cookie. They
also have no flour, so would be good for someone who isn't able to
eat wheat. They will, however, tie up your oven for 3-4 hours.

Heat oven to 250'F. Use nonstick cookie sheets, or line regular cookie
sheets with parchment paper. In a food processor with a metal blade,
process the sugar and coffee powder until the texture of the sugar
becomes very fine. In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg whites and
vanilla extract with an electric mixer at medium speed, until very
frothy. Add cream of tartar, and continue beating at medium speed
until soft peaks form. Increase beater speed to high, and gradually
beat in sugar-coffee mixture. Continue beating until soft peaks form
and mixture has a glossy sheen.

To pipe cookies from pastry bag: Fill pastry bag (or 1-gallon freezer
bag), fitted with Number 6 plain round pastry tube, with meringue.
Hold bag upright over prepared cookie sheets and squeeze out
meringue, leaving pastry tip buried in meringue, until you have piped
out a round about 1 1/2" in diameter. Lift up tip and stop squeezing.
Leave 1" between cookies. Or, drop by tablespoonfuls onto prepared
cookie sheet, leaving 2" between cookies.

Bake 1 hour without opening oven door. Turn off oven, and let
meringues dry in oven 2-3 hours more without opening oven door.
(After the first hour, it's okay to peek just once.) At this point
you can leave them in the oven overnight.

Remove the meringues from the cookie sheet with a spatula. Store in
airtight container. Makes about 3 dozen.

Cognac Cookies

appetizers, beverages, cookies, nuts, alcohol

6 ounce chocolate chips (semi-sweet)
2 1/2 cup vanilla wafers, crushed fine (a box; less some nibbles)
1 cup pecans (finely chopped; start with 8-10 oz whole
1/2 cup sugar (white, granulated)
1/4 cup corn syrup
1/3 cup cognac (use the best you can afford; , it makes a difference!)

Melt chocolate bits.  If you have never worked with melted chocolate
before, then use a double boiler with the burner set on low.

Crush vanilla wafers very fine (fineness is important).  Chop pecans (again
fineness is everything).  Add sugar, corn syrup and cognac (I use 1 nip of
cognac and  1/2 nip of rum, works fine and costs less). Stir in pecans and
wafer crumbs.  Now you learn why you were supposed to grind them very
finely.

By now the mixture should be a smooth paste.  Remove from heat and form
into about 1-inch balls. Roll balls in extra granulated sugar.

NOTES:

*  A rich chocolate no-bake cookie -- A terrific, very rich, no-bake
cookie. Adapted from a recipe in the "Silver Palate Good Times Cookbook."
Yield: makes 3-4 dozen.

*  Store these in an air-tight container; if you are a chocoholic, have
someone hide them from you.  They are best if you allow  them to age and
mellow.

: Difficulty:  Moderate to hard (melted chocolate is tricky, and rolling
the mixture into balls takes practice).
: Time:  30-60 minutes or more, depending on how deftly you can roll the
balls.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

cookies, chile

2 cup flour
8 ounce package cream cheese, softened
1/2 pound butter, softened
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup white vinegar
3  or 4 jalapeno peppers, chopped
1 1/2 cup sugar
12 ounce fresh cranberries
1  confectioners' sugar

Place flour in bowl of food processor.  With processor running, drop
in chunks of the cream cheese and butter. Process until dough is
formed.

(Alternatively, mix the cream cheese and butter in a large mixing
bowl by hand or with electric beater. Slowly blend in flour until
dough is formed.)

Wrap dough in wax paper or plastic wrap.  Chill for at least one hour.

While the dough is freezing, make the cranberry mixture:

Place the water and vinegar in a 3-quart saucepan. Bring to a boil
and let boil 5 minutes.

Add the jalapeno peppers and the sugar.  Return to a boil and let
boil 5 minutes.

Mix in the cranberries.  Return to a boil and let boil
5    minutes.

Remove from the heat and pour onto jelly roll pan. Chill for at least
one hour.

When ready to assemble the cookies:

Dust work surface with confectioners' sugar.  Working with a small
chunk of dough, roll dough to about 1/4" thick. Cut dough into 2"
squares. You can re-use the dough scraps.

Place dough squares on cookie sheet sprayed with vegetable oil spray
(do not *grease* the pan or you'll have a real mess!).

Put about 1 teaspoon cranberry-jalapeno relish in the center of each dough
square. Bring 2 corners of the dough-square up and seal well. (Cookie
should be shaped something like this:

:          /\
/    \ <--- Cranberry exposed here
| \  / |<--- Dough
| /  \ |
\   / <--- Cranberry exposed here
:       \ /

Bake 12 minutes at 350 degrees.  If cookies unfold during baking,
press them back into shape while warm.

*  Moist cookies with cranberries, apples and cinnamon -- Many years ago
one of my brothers complained to me that he didn't like cookies much, that
they were always too dry and pasty. I came up with this recipe for him. He
still doesn't like cookies, but the recipe has made its way to various
other people to become a favorite.

*  Don't store these in a cookie jar, they will get too mushy.

Cream Cheese Butter Cookies

cookies

1/2 pound butter
1 cup sugar
2 1/2 cup flour, all-purpose
1  egg yolk
4 ounce cream cheese
1  raspberry jam

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cream together the butter and sugar. Add
the flour and egg yolk and mix well. Add the cream cheese and mix well.

Roll into balls about 5/8 inch diameter.  Place them on an ungreased cookie
sheet (the cookies don't grow when baked, so they can be somewhat close
together).  Then press your thumb into each to flatten it and make an
indentation to hold some jam.  Fill it with jam.  Bake at 350 degrees F for
15 to 20 minutes.

You can use any flavor jam you like.  The jam is the only part of the
cookie that has any texture, so I prefer using it to jelly.

Don't eat the cookies straight from the oven, or you'll probably burn your
tongue.  The jam stays hotter much longer than the cookie.

Crispy Oatmeal Cookies

cookies

1/3 cup butter (margarine)
1/3 cup lightly packed brown sugar
1/4 cup warm water
1 cup flour, divided 1/4 cup aside
1 cup quick rolled oats
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda

My note:  these keep fairly well in a covered container, and freeze
well according to the cookbook. Try ginger (used in some Australian
ANZAC cookies) instead of cinnamon.

Cream butter and sugar together thoroughly, then beat in water. Set
aside 1/4 cup flour for rolling.  Mix together the remaining dry
ingredients, then stir them into the creamed mixture.

Add the remaining flour gradually to the dough until it is stiff
enough to roll.  Divide the dough into 3 lumps about the same size.
Roll each lump of dough out about 1/8 inch thick and cut into 12
pieces about the same size. This is much easier than trying to use a
cookie cutter if you need to know cookies per serving.

Place on a lightly greased cookie sheet.  Bake at 350 F about 10
minutes or until golden brown around the edges. Remove from pan,
cool. Store in a covered container. Makes about 36 cookies.

Cucidati

cookies, italian

      ----FILLING----
2 cup dried figs
1/4 cup yellow raisins
1/4 cup currants or dark raisins
1/4 cup candied orange peel
1/4 cup toasted, sliced almonds
1/4 cup toasted pine nuts
2 ounce bittersweet chocolate  chopped
1/3 cup apricot preserves
1/4 cup dark rum
1 teaspoon instant espresso coffee
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
      ----DOUGH----
3 1/3 cup flour
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
12 tablespoon lard or butter
2  eggs
1/3 cup milk
      ----EGG WASH FOR ASSEMBLING----
1  egg
1 pinch salt
1  confectioners' sugar

The name of these filled pastries is Cucidati, which is Sicilian for
Buccellati, or "little bracelets." FOR THE FILLING: Stem the figs and
quarter them. Place in a bowl and cover with boiling water; steep 10
minutes. Drain and chop coarsely in the food processor. Combine with
remaining ingredients. To prepare in advance, cover tightly with
plastic wrap and keep at a cool room temperature or in the
refrigerator up to 3 days. FOR THE DOUGH: Combine the flour, sugar
and baking powder in a bowl and stir to mix. Rub in the lard or
butter finely, leaving the mixture powdery. Beat the eggs and milk to
combine in a small bowl and stir into the flour mixture to form a
dough. Turn the dough out on a lightly floured surface and knead
lightly a few times. Wrap the dough in plastic and chill. Divide the
dough into 12 pieces and roll each into a cylinder about 12 inches
long. Flour the surface and the dough lightly and roll it into a
rectangle about 14 inches long and 3 inches wide. Place a line of the
filling down the center of each rectangle, using 1/12 of the filling
for each piece of dough. Bring up the dough around the filling and
pinch to seal. Turn the filled sausage of dough over so that the seam
is on the bottom and cut it into 3 1/2- to 4-inch lengths. Using a
sharp paring knife or single-edge razor blade, make a series of
diagonal slashes in the top of each little sausage. Pull and twist
gently, holding the sausage at each end to open the slashes. Transfer
the Cucidati as they are formed to paper- lined cookie sheets,
curving them into wide horseshoe shapes. Make an egg wash by beating
the egg and salt together with a fork until it is loose. Paint each
shape with the egg wash. Bake the Cucidati in a preheated 350F oven
about 20 minutes, or until they are a light golden color. Cool, dust
with confectioners' sugar and store the Cucidati in tins, between
layers of wax paper.

1  water
1  sugar
1  rosewater
1  ginger, ground
1  almond syrup
1  maple syrup
1  biscotti
1  whipping cream
1  fruit, fresh

Prepare a simple syrup by bringing 2 parts of water and 1 part sugar
to a boil. Remove from heat and add flavoring. Rosewater (to taste)
for a Middle Eastern accent or ground ginger (and use the ginger
biscuits) for a spicier dish or choose almond syrup or maple syrup or
a good shot of brandy. Place as many biscotti as desired in a shallow
bowl or on a plate. Spoon a little of the hot syrup over the
biscotti. You will use approximately 1 Tbsp per cookie.  Let soak for
5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, whip some cream. You'll want about 1 Tbsp
per cookie. By the time the cream is whipped, the biscotti should be
softened. Drain off any excess syrup and spoon the cream onto the
soaked cookies. Serve immediately. (Good, too, the next day when it's
soggy). Fresh fruit such as strawberries or cherries are a wonderful
foil against the dessert's sweet richness.

Dirty Snowballs

cookies

1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 cup sugar, granulated
4 ounce chocolate, unsweetened
4  eggs
2 teaspoon vanilla
2 teaspoon baking powder
2 cup flour
1 cup sugar, powdered

Melt chocolate in double boiler or microwave.  Combine melted
chocolate, granulated sugar, vanilla and vegetable oil in a mixer.

Add eggs, one at a time, blending well each time. Sift (or stir)
together flour and baking powder, add to wet mixture. Mix well.

Let stand in refrigerator for a few hours or overnight. Roll dough
into small balls (no more than about 1 inch in diameter), and roll in
powdered sugar until coated. Bake for 12 minutes in a preheated 350
degree F. oven.

NOTES:

*  Chocolate cookies with powdered sugar coating -- This recipe was
handed down to me from my step-sister who got it from her mother.
Yield: Several dozen.

*  The temperature is very important:  any lower and the cookies
won't bake properly; any higher and the powdered sugar will glaze.

*  If you coat your palms with powdered sugar before attempting to
roll the balls your hands will get less sticky. Put the dough back in
the refrigerator whenever you are not actively using it; it is easier
to work when cold.

*  You don't actually have to bake these; they make a reasonable
fudge when left uncooked, but if left in the refrigerator for several
days before baking they will become dried out. When done, the unused
powdered sugar will have small shards of chocolate in it; these can
be strained out and the sugar will be re-usable.

Double-Frosted Brownies

cookies

      ----BATTER----
2 ounce chocolate, unsweetened (2 squares)
1/4 pound butter
2 large eggs
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup nuts, chopped (walnuts are traditio; nal)
      ----FIRST FROSTING----
1 1/2 cup sugar
1/3 cup butter
1/2 cup half-and-half (also called light cr; eam)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
      ----SECOND FROSTING----
3 ounce chocolate, unsweetened (3 squares)

Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F.  Melt about 2 ounce of chocolate and the
butter in a heavy saucepan, then let it cool. Be careful not to let
the chocolate burn.

Beat the eggs in a large bowl until they are blended. Add about 1 cup
200 g of sugar and mix well. Stir in chocolate-and-butter mixture.
Mix until the chocolate is fully incorporated, with no streakiness.
Add the vanilla, flour, salt and nuts. Stir just until the flour is
incorporated; over-stirring will make a tough brownie.

Spread the mixture in a greased pan, about 11 x 7 inches, that is
about 1 1/2 inches deep. Bake in pre-heated oven for 20 to 25
minutes. Cool in the pan on a rack. While it is cooling, follow these
instructions to make the first frosting:

Mix about 1 1/2 cups sugar, about 1/3 cup butter and about 1/2 cup of
half-and-half in a heavy, medium-size saucepan. Bring to a boil, then
cook over moderate heat without stirring until a small amount of the
mixture forms a soft ball when dropped in ice water, or it reaches
236 degrees F. on a candy thermometer.

Remove from heat immediately and cool in a pan of ice-water until the
candy is lukewarm. DANGER: melted sugar cools very slowly. You can
burn yourself badly by testing it with your finger.

Add about 1 teaspoon vanilla extract to the candy. Beat it until it is
creamy and of a spreading consistency. This is most easily done with
an electric mixer, although you can use a heavy wire whip. Spread the
frosting over the brownies.

Melt the remaining 3 ounce chocolate and spread over the frosting just
put on the brownies. Cover as evenly as possible. Cool for several
hours in a refrigerator, then bring to room temperature and cut into
pieces to serve.

Be very careful when melting chocolate.  It burns easily. A double
boiler is probably the best way thing to use.

It is critical to cook the first frosting to just the right point. If
cooked too little, it will be too thin to beat to a creamy
consistency. If cooked too much, it will be too brittle. So keep a
close eye on it; sugar tends to cook slowly to the soft-ball stage,
then it cooks quickly.

NOTES:

*  Very rich brownies with double frosting -- This recipe is for
people who like intense chocolate flavor. The result is a brownie
with a fondant frosting, covered with unsweetened chocolate.  They
are very rich, with an interesting combination of textures. This
recipe is not for beginners.

3  raw egg whites
1 cup dark raisins
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup light brown sugar -- packed
1 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup non-fat dry milk powder
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
2 1/2 cup quaker brand quick-cooking
1  rolled oats
1 cup all-purpose flour

Put molasses, egg whites and raisins into blender and blend on high
speed just to mince but not to puree (about 5-10 seconds). Empty
mixture into medium mixing bowl. With mixer beat in on medium speed
each of the remaining ingredients, beating well after each addition,
adding both the oats and flour in small portions. Switch to mixing
spoon if dough becomes too stiff for mixer. Lightly spray cookie
sheet with Pam and wipe off excess lightly with paper towel; any
excess of the cookie sheet may burn while cookies are baking. You
need only a very light film of the Pam just to keep cookies from
sticking. Use 1 measuring teaspoonful of dough for each cookie and
place 2" apart on prepared cookie sheet. Bake in preheated 350~ oven
6-8 minutes. Do not overbake. Cool on paper towels, removing from

1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs
2 large egg whites
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon unsweetened coco powder
2 teaspoon instant coffee
1 ounce unsweet. chocolate - melted
1/2 teaspoon pure almond extract

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Spread almonds on a baking sheet and
bake for 12 to 14 minutes, or until lightly toasted. Set aside.

Stir together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Whisk
together eggs, egg whites and vanilla, and add to the dry
ingredients. Mix just until smooth. In a small bowl, combine cocoa,
instant coffee and 4 teaspoon. water. Divide the dough in half. To one
half, add the cocoa mixture and melted chocolate. Mix just until
incorporated. To the other half, stir in almond extract and almonds.

Place half of the almond dough on a well-floured work surface. Pat
into a 4x8 inch rectangle. Top with half of chocolate dough. Roll up
into a log b, then roll back and forth to form a 14 inch log, 1 1/2
inches thick. Repeat with the remaining doughs. Place the logs on a
prepared baking sheet. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until firm to
the touch. Transfer the logs to a rack to cool. Reduce the oven
temperature to 300 degrees F.

Cut the logs diagonally into 1/2 inch slices. Stand the slices
upright on the baking sheet and bake for 40 more minutes. Let cool

* This makes 2 loaves. For easy doubling of this recipe, make 2
recipes, one all almond and one all chocolate.

* Before putting chocolate dough on top of almond dough, brush a
little water between them. Also, an egg white whisked with a little
water brushed on logs before baking gives them a nice look.

about 1" in diameter. Cover with plastic wrap, and twist the ends of
the wrap to force dough into a smooth cylinder. Refridgerate until
almost firm (about 30 min). Spread about half the nuts on a work
surface (a wide, 2" deep plastic container works well, and is
re-sealable afterwards for storage). Roll one log in the nuts so that
the entire surface is coated. Re-wrap and chill for at least 30 min.
Repeat with the other log. Heat oven to 350~. Cut the chilled dough
into slices about 3/8" thick. Put on ungreased baking sheets about 2"
apart, and bake until edges start to brown, about 8-10 min.

Options:  Replace Nuts with coloured sprinkles, or coloured sugar
crystals. Or with the tiny coloured chocolate chips you can find in
Bulk stores (very festive).  Or coconut, dyed or white. Use your

As each panful is toasted and while the cookies are still hot, remove
the cookies, place them on a clean surface and place a strip of your
fortune telling paper into the center of each. Fold up* the cookies.
9. Put the cookies on a rack to cool. 10. Make another batch. Notes:
FOLDING: This is a case of a picture being worth a thousand words,
but the general idea is: 1. Fold the cookie in half, (with the
fortune inside). 2. Bring the two "points/corners" together towards
the back, as if you were going to fold into quarters, but keep the
pancake flat. "You can have some fun with your family and friends
with these cookies. Before you begin baking them, write out fortunes
on 18 Small pieces of paper (about 1/2x1-1/2 inches). Set these aside
within easy reach because you will be inserting them in the cookies
as you make them. ++++-

French Apricot Cream Cheese Bars

cookies, deserts, bars

      ----CRUST----
1 pkg French vanilla cake mix
1/3 cup unsalted butter or margarine
1 large egg
      ----FILLING----
8 ounce pkg. cream cheese,softened
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 large egg
12 ounce jar apricot preserves*

* I used Bing Cherry Preserves and they were delicious.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Generously grease 13x9-inch pan. In a
large bowl, combine cake mix, butter and egg; Mix only until crumbly.
Gently spoon 1 1/2 cup of the crumbled mixture into a mixing cup; set
aside for topping. Press remaining crumb mixture on the bottom of the
greased pan.

Bake at 350 degrees F. for 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a smaller mixing bowl, combine cream cheese, sugar,
vanilla and egg; beat until smooth. Set aside.

Spread preserves evenly over hot crust. Then spread cream cheese
mixture evenly over preserves.

Sprinkle reserved topping mixture over cream cheese.

Bake at 350 degrees F. for an additional 30 minutes or until topping
is light golden brown. Cool to room temperature, then chill until
serving. Store in refrigerator.

Note: The dough must be crumbly. I had to add a bit more flour to the
reserved 1 1/2 cups to get the proper consistency as I mixed it
beyond the crumbly stage and a smooth dough started to form. You
don't want  balls of dough, but lumpy CRUMBS!

Recipe by: Williams-Sonoma Kitchen Library - Cookies and Preparation
Time: on tablespoon
Preheat oven to 350~. Line 2 large, heavy baking sheets with
aluminum foil. Lightly butter foil.
Combine cream, granulated sugar, brown sugar and butter in a heavy
saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, just until
sugars dissolve and butter melts. Add almonds, flour, ginger, and
orange and lemon zests. Bring mixture to a boil, stirring constantly.
Remove from heat.
Drop 1 tablespoon batter (batter will be runny) onto a prepared
baking sheet. Repeat five times, spacing cookies 3 inches apart.
Repeat with second baking sheet.
Bake until deep brown, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven. Using a
round cookie cutter or a glass 3 inches in diameter, push hot cookie
edges in toward center to neaten them, shaping into 3-inch rounds.
Slide foil off sheets. Line the same sheets with new foil, butter
foil and repeat with remaining batter.
Cool cookies completely on the foil. Carefully peel cookies off
foil and arrange them smooth-side up on the baking sheets. Spoon 1
teaspoon of the hot chocolate coating in center of each and, using a
small icing spatula or knife, spread to edges. Refrigerate until
chocolate is set, about 30 minutes. Store layered between waxed paper
in airtight container in refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
Makes about 2 dozen.

CHOCOLATE COATING:  Combine chocolate and shortening in top of
double boiler. Melt over (not touching) water just until smooth,
stirring occasionally. Remove from heat. Alternatively, melt
chocolate and shortening in heatproof bowl placed over (not touching)
simmering water. Dip one flat side of biscotti into warm chocolate or
spread like icing. Refrigerate until chocolate sets.
Makes about 3/4 cup.

Gingerbread Biscotti

cookies

1 cup almonds, blanched
3/4 cup sugar
1/4 pound butter
1/2 cup molasses, dark
1/4 cup ginger, fresh; minced
3  egg
3 cup flour
1/2 tablespoon baking powder
1 tablespoon cinnamon, ground
1 teaspoon nutmeg, ground
1/2 teaspoon cloves, ground
1/2 teaspoon allspice, ground

Place almonds in a 8 to 9 inch square pan.  Bake in a 350 F. oven
until golden, 10 to 15 minutes.  Let cool, coarsely chop, and set
aside. In large bowl of an electric mixer, beat sugar, butter,
molasses, and ginger until smooth.  Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating
after each addition. In a bowl, stir flour, baking powder, cinnamon,
nutmeg, cloves, allspice and almonds. Add to egg mixture; stir to
blend. On two greased 12x15 inch baking sheets, use well-floured
hands to pat dough into 4 flat loaves, spacing them evenly on sheets;
each loaf should be about 1/2 inch thick, 2 inches wide and the
length of the baking sheet. Bake in a 350 F. oven until browned at
edges and springy to touch, about 25 minutes; switch positions of
pans halfway through baking. Let loaves stand on baking sheets until
cool to touch, then cut into long, 1/2-inch thick diagonal slices. On
baking sheets, arrange slices close together with a cut side down.
Return to oven and bake at 350 F. until cookies are brown, 15 to 18
minutes longer; switch positions of pans halfway through baking.
Transfer biscotti to racks and let cool completely. Serve, or store
airtight up to 1 month; freeze for longer storage.

Gingerbread House~ My Recipe

cookies

1 cup melted solid crisco
1 cup granulated sugar
1 cup light or dark karo
2 single large eggs
5 3/4 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon ginger
2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon cloves
1 teaspoon nutmeg

Makes 2-3 Medium-sized houses.

Pour melted Crisco into mixing bowl. Cool slightly; add sugar and
Karo, blending well. Add eggs, mixing all until smooth and creamy.
Put salt, baking soda and spices into mixture and begin to add flour,
just a little at a time. DON'T HURRY THIS STEP! Continue adding as
much flour as the dough will absorb. Bake house pieces at 375 degrees
for 5-8 minutes. Hints: Make permenant pattern pieces of mylar or
other plastic sheet. To roll out: Use heavy duty foil (splash a few
drops of water under it so it will stay stationary), roll the dough
out, cut into desired shapes that are 1" apart. Remove the excess
dough. Place the foil holding the pieces to bake on a cardboard,
place in oven and REMOVE THE CARDBOARD BEFORE SHUTTING OVEN DOOR. If
pieces bake together, cut apart immedietely after removing from oven.
Windows: Must be cut before baking. Can add crushed hard candy for
"glass" To Assemble" Use royal Icing: 1 1/2 c warm water, 12 Tbsps
Meringue powder, 4 pounds powdered sugar. Beat the water and
mer.powder til frothy. Add as much p. sugar as necassary. Do not make
icing stiff or house will not hold together as long. Using #5 tip,
squeeze out icing on both sides of back of house. Stand it up and add
sides. Prop with cans of soup, ect., if it doesn't stay firmly
together. Place icing on ends of standing sides and add house front.
Let dry for 10-15 minutes, then add roof and chimney. Decorate with
desired candies using royal icing to place decorations on. Let dry

the dough is sticky, add more flour, a little at a time, until it is
easier to work.  Divide the dough into two equal parts. Wrap each
half in waxed paper and refrigerate over- night. Do not freeze. The
next day, preheat the oven to 350.  Lightly grease two large baking
sheet with butter or vegetable shortening. On a floured work survace,
roll out the dough to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Cut out the cookies
using a 3-inch-tall gingerbread man cookie cutter. Place the cookies
1 inch apart on the baking sheets. Create the eyes and buttons with
the raisins.  Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the cookies have
browned around the edges. Remove from the oven. After the cookies
have cooled for 2 to 3 minutes, but are still warm to the touch, use
a spatula to transfer them to wire racks to cool completely.

Gingerbread Teddy Bears

cookies

1 cup butter (or margarine)
2/3 cup brown sugar
2/3 cup corn syrup and/or molasses
4 cup flour
1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1  egg; lightly beaten
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

In a saucepan combine butter, brown sugar and corn syrup. Cook and
stir
over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Pour into large mixing
bowl; cool
5 minutes. Sift together flour, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and baking
soda.
Add egg and vanilla to butter mixture; mix well. Add flour mixture;
beat
til well mixed. Divide dough in half, cover and chill 2 hours or
overnight. For each bear, shape dough into one 1-inch ball, one
3/4-inch
ball, six 1/2-inch balls and one 1/4-inch ball. On ungreased cookie
sheet
flatten the 1-inch ball to 1/2" thickness for body. Attach the
3/4-inch
ball for head and flatten to 1/2" thickness. Attach the 1/2-inch
balls for
arms, legs and ears. Attach the 1/4-inch ball for nose. Bake at 350
degrees for 8 to 10 minutes, cool and decorate. I usually make these
smaller than described here; about 1/2 the size. Also, the ears
start to
look like MOUSE ears if they're not a little smaller than the arms
and
legs. Roll the nose ball to make it more oval in shape and place it
on the
LOWER half of the bear's face. These can be decorated with any
icing-- I
use tinted Royal icing made from meringue powder to add eyes, nose
and bow
tie to each bear. For Easter, make these into bunnies. Use only
light corn
syrup, no molasses. Substitute white sugar for the brown sugar. Omit
spices and add a bit of almond extract if desired. Make them the
same way,
but make two long ears on the top and two cheek-balls instead of the
nose-ball. Decorate with pastel icings.       Karen Mintzias TCVC49A

Golden Biscotti (Mandelbr T)

cookies

2 cup flour
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup sugar
5 teaspoon orange zest; finely chopped*
2  egg
1/4 cup oil
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1 2/3 cup almonds, unblanched sliced
1/3 cup almonds, unblanched whole
      ----TOPPING----
2 tablespoon sugar
1/8 teaspoon cinnamon, ground
1  egg white

*Remove zest from orange in lengthwise strips with a vegetable
peeler, and chop finely. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Food Processor
Method: In a medium bowl, sift together all but 1/4 c of the flour
with the baking powder, baking soda, and salt, and whisk to mix it
well. In a food processor with the metal blade, process the sugar and
orange zest until the zest is finely minced. Add the eggs and process
for about 30 seconds or until thoroughly blended. Scrape the sides of
the bowl. With the motor running, add the oil and extracts and
process until blended. Add the sliced almonds and process until
finely chopped. Add the flour mixture and process for about 7 seconds
or until the flour is almost incorporated. (There will be some flour
clinging to the sides of the work bowl. Do not overprocess as the
dough will be too stiff to incorporate the flour completely in the
processor.) Electric Mixer Method: Finely grate the orange zest.
Finely chop the sliced almonds.  Place them both in a medium bowl.
Sift together all but 1/4 cup of the flour with the baking powder,
baking soda, and salt and add to the nuts and zest. Whisk together to
mix them well. In a large mixing bowl, beat the sugar and eggs for
several minutes, until very thick and pale in color. With the mixer
at medium speed, beat in the oil and extracts. At low speed,
gradually beat in the flour mixture. For both methods: Scrape the
dough (including any flour from the work bowl) onto a lightly flour
counter and knead the dough, adding the remaining 1/4 c flour to form
a soft, non-sticky dough. Shape the dough into two 2-inch wide
cylinders. Each will be about 7 1/2 inches long. Line up the whole
almonds lengthwise in rows along the dough and press them well into
the dough. With the palms of your hands, roll the cylinders on the
counter, enclosing the almonds and maintaining the 2-inch diameters
of the cylinders. Place the cylinders 2 inches apart on a cookie
sheet. In a small bowl, stir together the sugar and cinnamon for the
topping. Beat the egg white. Brush the cylinders lightly with the
beaten egg white and sprinkle them with the cinnamon topping. Bake on
the upper rack of the oven for 30 minutes or until lightly browned
and very firm. Cool the cylinders on the cookie sheet for 15 minutes
or until just warm. Slip them off the sheet and onto a counter.  With
a serrated knife, cut diagonal 1/2 inch slices. Place the slices
closely together on lightly buttered cookie sheets. Toast the slices
for about 8 minutes. Using a small metal spatula, turn them and bake
for another 8 minutes or until golden brown.  For even baking, rotate
the cookie sheets from top to bottom and front to back halfway
through the baking period. [I NEVER do this, because I think you lose
too much of your heat when you open the door to do it, so you're no
longer baking at the correct temperature. ~-Leti] Use a small, angled
metal spatula or pancake turner to transfer the cookies to wire racks
to cool completely. Store in an airtight container at room
temperature. Keeps several months. Smart cookie hints: * Unbleached
flour has more gluten-forming proteins, which help to hold the
almonds in the dough and make the dough less fragile. * When the
almonds are placed lengthwise, they do not fall out of the
baked dough as readily and are more attractive when sliced. *
Biscotti can be tricky to cut into neat slices. If the cylinders are
too hot or completely cold, the slices tend to break. When cutting
the biscotti, hold the cylinder near the end being sliced and press
it gently on top. If it is still crumbly, try popping it in the oven
for another 5 minutes. Using coarsely chopped almonds instead of
whole almonds is another solution, but they are less dramatic in
appearance.

Government Cookies

cookies

1 cup packed dark brown sugar
1 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup softened butter
1/2 cup shortening
2  eggs
1  and 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
1  and 1/2 cups flour
1 teaspoon baking soda

Tasks and Milestones: After procurement actions for the above required
commodities, and subsequently identified appliances and
instrumentalities, decontainerize materials. Perform succeeding
measurement tasks sequentially.

In a mixing bowl the incumbent will execute materials allocation for
the brown sugar, the granulated sugar, the butter, and the shortening
in an approved mixing container; order is precedential and
unwaiverable. Incumbent will next impact the interfacement of eggs
and vanilla, avoiding an overallocation scenario.

To avoid at all cost being on the critical path, incumbent shall next
perform materials loading of lour and soda into a bowl and aggregate.
Equalize with prior mixture and develop intense and continous liaison
among materials until minimum slack prevails. Assimilate key
chocolate and nut subprojects and execut stirring operations.

In a parallel task, an equally skilled and proficient incumbent will
take actio to prepare the heating environment for throughput by
manually setting the oven baking unit to a temperature of 350 degrees
fahrenheit. When performed in a reasonable proficient manner, this
will prevent a precedence relationship between the predecessor and
successor creating a lag.

Incumbent shall next allocate the aggregated materials in a dangling
fashion from a teaspoon implement onto an ungreased cookie sheet at
intervals sufficient to permit planned and actual separation of
throughputs, thereby creating the maximum positive slack practicable
under prevailing conditions.

Position aforesaid cooking sheet into above conditioned oven
instrument, in a bake or equivalent manufacturer recommended
situation, and monitor for an earliest finish of eight minutes and an
absolute finish of ten minutes baking aspect.  Incumbent is to
initiate sequentially the coordination of baked materials within the
cooling rack function, and subsequently to containerize when ambient
condition is attained.

Projected value:  3 dozen cookie units.

Great-Shape Cookies

2 single large eggs
1 tablespoon milk
      ----KNEAD IN 1/4 C FLOUR LATER----
2 1/2 cup all-purpose flour,save 1/4 c
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 teaspoon almond

CHILL DOUGH SEVERAL HOURS OR OVERNIGHT: Could put the dough in the
freezer to chill, if in a hurry, for 1-2 hours. Heat oven to 300
degrees. Grease cookie sheet (only ONCE). No need to grease it each
time.
Add ingredients together, saving out the 1/4 cup of flour. Knead
the 1/4 cup flour into the dough now, chill. Roll out, using flour on
surface, cutters and rolling pin, generously. Try to get more flour
on tiny places.
This is a great recipe for the creased cookie cutters, because it
is delicious and dough does not lose its shape. For this type of
cutter, roll to about 1/4" thickness, so dough is just thick enough
to leave the cutter imprints. Ordinarily, roll dough to 1/4"
thickness for best results. Any cookie will lose detail and shape
when it is too thick. This cookie is good iced with thin royal icing.
Cookie stays soft, but is not terribly fragile. Source: Shared with
me by Mary Billersen of Cin. because I helped her replace some

cookies, deserts, herbs

1 1/2 cup unsalted butter (3 sticks) - at roo; m temperature
2/3 cup sugar
2 tablespoon fresh rosemary or
2 teaspoon dried rosemary
2 1/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white or brown rice flour

2 teaspoon sugar for topping (opt'l.)

Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.

Cream butter in a large bowl until pale yellow and light. Add the
sugar; continue mixing until the mixture is fluffy.

If you are using fresh rosemary, mince it.  If you are using dried
rosemary, crush it in a mortar and pestle, or by using a rolling pin
on a flat surface, until it is fine but not a powder.

Add both flours, the salt and the rosemary to the butter mixture; mix
until thoroughly combined.  The dough will be somewhat soft.
Refrigerate it for 1 hour, if necessary, so that it is firm enough to
roll.

Roll the dough out to form a rectangle about 10 x 14" and 1/4" thick.
Cut cookies into 1 1/2 x 2" rectangles or any other shape you like.
Place them about 1/2" apart on the prepared baking sheets. Sprinkle
them with the sugar topping if desired; bake at 375 F. in the center
of the oven until they are gold at the edges, 12 to 15 minutes.

Remove the cookies from the oven and transfer them to wire racks to
cool. Pack in an airtight container. The cookies will keep, their
flavor improving, for at least a week.

Note:  The author says that these cookies are much better two days
after they are baked, and suggests planning accordingly.

Note: These cookies, which provide 2 grams of dietary fiber each,
aren't terribly sweet. We like them this way, but if you prefer them
sweeter, you can add 1 tablespoon Weight Watchers dry substitute when
adding the other sugars and this will not change the nutritive

Honey Cookies (Melomakarona)

cookies, greek

1  karen mintzias
1 cup butter
3/4 cup caster sugar
3/4 cup maize or peanut oil
1  orange; grated rind only
6 cup plain flour
4 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 cup orange juice
      ----NUT FILLING (OPTIONAL----
1 tablespoon honey
2 teaspoon orange juice
1 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts
2 drop almond essence
      ----HONEY SYRUP----
1 cup sugar
1 cup water
1/2  cinnamon stick
1 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1  thin strip of lemon rind
1/4 cup honey

Oven temperature: 180 C (350 F)

Beat butter and sugar with orange rind until creamy. Gradually add
oil and continue beating until mixture is very light and fluffy. Stir
in flour alternately with orange juice. Knead dough lightly with
hands for
1    minute.

Take a scant tablespoon of dough and flatten it a little. Place a
teaspoon of the nut filling in the centre and fold dough over to
enclose filling.

Shape into ovals, pinching ends to a point.  Decorate tops with tines
of fork or by crimping cookies diagonally across top in four rows
with special crimper (see NOTE), or leave them plain.

Place on lightly greased baking trays and bake in a moderate oven for
20-25 minutes until golden brown. Cool on wire racks.

Dip in boiling syrup, four at a time, turning cookies once. Leave in
syrup 10 seconds in all, longer if well-soaked cookies are preferred.
Lift out onto a plate and leave until cool.

(If no nut filling is used, sprinkle tops with crushed walnuts or
toasted sesame seeds and cinnamon.  Only those which are to be served
should be dipped; store remainder in an airtight container and dip
when required.

TO MAKE NUT FILLING: Thin honey down with orange juice and blend into
remaining ingredients.

TO MAKE HONEY SYRUP: Place ingredients in a heavy-based saucepan and
stir over heat until sugar dissolves. Bring to the boil and boil over
moderately high heat for 10 minutes and skim.  Let syrup boil on a
moderate heat while dipping cookies.  Add a little water to syrup
when it thickens too much during dipping.

NOTE: Icing crimpers will be familiar to many pastrycooks and cake
decorators who work with icing. If you don't own a crimper (or have
never seen one), have the family handyman cut a piece of tin or
aluminium plate about 2.5 x 10 cm (1 x 4 inches). Bend metal in half
over a thin rod and cut 6 to 8 evenly spaced saw-like teeth on the
narrow edges. Curl the "teeth" slightly inwards.

* for the pastry board

This legacy from my Hungarian grandmother links my children to their
Old World heritage in a most pleasing way! No one can eat only one of
these rich little crescents. Make sure you let the dough chill
overnight to make it easy to work with.

Editor's Note: You may want to cut recipe in half for a smaller
yield.

In a bowl, cut the butter and shortening into the flour until the
mixture is crumbly. In a separate bowl, mix the yeast into sour
cream, then add egg yolks and salt. Combine with the flour mixture.
Mix until smooth and the sides of the bowl are clean.

Form into a large ball and chill, covered, overnight.

To make filling, mix walnuts, sugar, cinnamon, vanilla and stiffly
beaten egg whites together in a bowl. To make egg wash mix egg yolk
and few drops of water in a small bowl.

Preheat oven to 350ø. Sprinkle granulated sugar onto a pastry board.
Divide the dough into six portions. Work with one portion at a time,
refrigerating the dough you are not using. Roll out the dough to
1/8-inch thick and sprinkle with more sugar. Cut into 2 x 2-inch
squares. Place a bit of the nut filling along one end of the square
and roll up. Form into a crescent. Place seam side down on a greased
cookie sheet. Paint with egg wash. Bake at 350ø for 15-20 minutes.
Remove from oven and cool on wire racks.

1 cup molasses
1 cup white sugar
1 cup shortening
1 cup hot water
3 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground ginger

      ----FROSTING----
2  egg whites
3 cup confectioners sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1  food coloring (optional)

Children love these because the ginger and molasses flavors are not
overwhelming.

In a large bowl, mix molasses, sugar, shortening and hot water. Stir
to combine thoroughly, although shortening doesn't need to melt
completely.

In a separate bowl, mix baking soda, ginger and cinnamon with 4 cups
of flour. Mix into liquids, stirring to blend well. Gradually add
enough of the additional flour to make a dough stiff enough to roll.
Chill 1-2 hours before baking.

Preheat oven to 350ø. Grease cookie sheets. Roll out dough to about
1/6-inch thick and cut shapes with your favorite cookie cutter. Bake
8-11 minutes at 350ø until done. Cool completely and frost with
decorative frosting. Cookies can also be dusted with decorative sugar
or sprinkles prior to baking.

To make frosting, beat egg whites until frothy, then beat in sugar
and vanilla. If you like, separate the icing into several bowls and
add a drop or two of food coloring. To yellow, add 1/2 teaspoon lemon
extract.

NOTES:

*  Delicious high-fiber oatmeal drop cookies -- These oatmeal cookies are
for cookie lovers to splurge with. Not only are they great tasting, but
they are very high in fiber content and easy to make. The recipe is mine
and is based on several different ideas in different cookbooks as how to
best to make them. In fun, I call them "Invisible Oatmeal Cookies" because
they are wont to disappear whenever unguarded. Enjoy.

*  If any children (young or old) live within smelling distance of your
stove, make extra cookies for when they suddenly show up for an unexpected
visit.

*  The recipe may be halved, doubled, or whatever without harm.  The batter
as well as the baked cookies freeze well. Thaw batter on countertop. Thaw
cookies either in microwave or in oven.

Jam Cookies

cookies, baking, vegatarian, vegetarian

3/4 cup rolled oats
1 1/2 cup wholewheat flour
1/4 cup oil
1/2 cup maple syrup, or other liquid - swee; tener
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 dash almond extract
1  raspberry or other fruit jam - as n; eeded

Place the oats in a blender and grind until you have a flour. Place in a
mixing bowl with the remaining ingredients. Mix well. If the mixture
seems too wet, add a little more flour. You want a dough that is
stiff enough to hold together when you place it on a cookie sheet.

Divide the dough into 13 portions.  Roll each portion in your hands
into a ball and place on a lightly oiled cookie sheet. Press down so
that the cookie dough is flattened and make a thumb imprint in the
centre of each cookie. Fill the indentation with jam (raspberry is my
favourite for this, but any flavour could be used).

Bake in a preheated oven at 350F for 20 minutes or until the cookies
are cooked through and lightly browned. Cool on wire racks.

Kalitsounia Me Kanella (Cretan Cheese-Cinnamo

cookies, greek

1  karen mintzias
1 1/2 cup fresh mizithra or ricotta
2 tablespoon grated hard ricotta
2  eggs; separated
1/2 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoon butter; melted
4 tablespoon milk (or more)
2 cup all-purpose flour
1 pinch salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1  confectioners' sugar

For the filling, combine the cheeses, lightly beaten
egg yolks, sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and melted
butter in a bowl. The mixture should be thick enough
to mound, but not stiff; add 1 tablespoon milk, if
necessary.  Set aside while you make the dough.

Sift the flour and salt into a bowl, then cut in the
butter and mix by rubbing between your fingers.  Mix
in the vanilla, egg whites, and enough milk to make a
soft dough.  Knead until smooth and elastic, then
break off small pieces and roll as thin of a dime.
(The dough will be elastic and can be rolled easily.)
Cut into circles 4-inches in diameter (teacup size),
then on each circle place a teaspoon of the cheese
filling.  Wet the circle edge with water or milk and
fold over to form a half-moon, then seal with the
tines of a fork or pastry wheel.  Arrange the
Kaltisounia on buttered cookie sheets and bake in a
moderate oven (350 F) for 25 minutes, or until the
pastry puffs up and turns a light chestnut color.
Remove from the oven, and place on racks, and dust
with confectioners' sugar and cinnamon.  Serve hot or
cold.

1 cup aunt jemima pancake mix
2 pkg good seasons Italian mild --
1  salad dressing mix
3 tablespoon all-purpose unbleached
1  flour
2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup lemon juice
2 teaspoon vegetable cooking oil

Wash chicken pieces, pat dry, and allow to air dry in
refrigerator for 1 or more hours. Combine the last 5
ingredients to make a paste. Spread the paste over the
chicken. Stack pieces in a bowl, cover, and let stand
in refrigerator overnight. About one hour before
serving, heat about 1-1/2 pints of cooking oil in a
heavy saucepan or deep-fry pot to 425F. Oil should be
about 3 inches deep. While oil is heating, put milk
and club soda in a deep narrow bowl and dip each piece
of chicken in the liquid; letting the excess liquid
drip off. Dust pieces lightly, but evenly with Aunt
Jemima Pancake Mix. Do not overcoat. Air dry the
pieces for a few minutes without letting the pieces
touch each other. Deepfry a few pieces at a time in
the hot oil, and place on a cookie sheet; bake
uncovered for 30 minutes in the oven at 350F.

Key Lime Coconut Cookies

cookies, deserts

1 cup sweetened condensed milk
4 tablespoon key lime juice
4 tablespoon all-purpose flour
2 cup unsweetened coconut flakes
4 tablespoon sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease 2 baking sheets.

Combine the condensed milk, Key lime juice, and flour
in a medium bowl. Stir in the grated coconut and then
the sugar.  If using sweetened coconut, taste the
mixture before adding the sugar.  Add the sugar only
if you think it is necessary.  The cookie should have
a tangy flavor from the Key lime juice.  Drop
teaspoons of the mixture onto a baking sheet, leaving
2 inches between each cookie; they will spread while
baking. Bake for 25 minutes until they just start to
turn golden. Remove from the pan to a rack to cool.
Store in an airtight container.

Kiffles

cookies, deserts

2 cup flour, (heaping)
3 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon sour cream, heaping
1 cup butter
3  egg yolks
1 cup prune butter

Cream butter, sour cream, and sugar. Add egg yolks,
then flour. Knead with hands until well blended,
adding a little more flour if needed. Divide dough
into 6-8 sections, pat each into a flat piece, then
chill. Roll out, between waxed paper, each section
like a pie crust. Cut with a sharp knife - 4 cross
cuts to make 8 triangles. Drop 1/2 teaspoon of prune
butter onto each triangle, roll up starting at wide
end. Put on greased cookie sheet. Bake 375 degrees or
till light brown. If desired, sprinkle with powdered
sugar.   Even though these have very little sugar,
they are fabulous. They even give Kolaches some stiff
competition.

Kifli (Hungarian Walnut Cookies)

cookies, christmas, hungarian

      ----DOUGH----
4 3/4 cup unsifted all-purpose flour
2 cup butter or margarine
4 large egg yolks, slightly beaten
1 cup sour cream
      ----FILLING----
1 1/4 pound shelled walnuts (about 5
1  cups), ground
1 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup milk
1 tablespoon almond extract
      ----GLAZE----
1 large egg, beaten
1  confectioners' sugar

Make dough: in a large bowl, place the flour and the
butter.  Using a pastry blender or two knives, cut the
butter into the flour until the mixture resembles
coarse crumbs.  Add the egg yolks and sour cream; stir
with a fork until combined.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board or
pastry cloth.  Knead the dough with your hands until
it is smooth and can be shaped into a ball.  If dough
is too sticky, knead in more flour.  If desired, wrap
dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate.

Make filling: in a medium-sized bowl, place the ground
walnuts, granulated sugar, milk and almond extract.
Using a wooden spoon, stir in walnut mixture until
ingredients are thoroughly combined.  Prehead oven to
400F. Grease baking sheets with solid vegetable
shortening.

To shape Kifli: divide the dough into quarters; wrap
three of the quarters separately in plastic wrap and
set aside.  On a lightly floured surface, roll out the
remaining quarter of the dough to a 15" x 12"
rectangle that is 1/8" thick.

Using a pastry wheel, cut the rectangle of dough into
3-inch squares. Place a heaping teaspoon of the walnut
filling in the center of each square; bring one corner
of the dough over the filling to the opposite corner;
pinch edges together.

Place Kifli on baking sheets; brush with the beaten
egg.  Bake for 10 minutes or until cookies are golden
brown.  Remove from the baking sheet. Fill the bottom
of a pie place with confectioners' sugar.  Roll Kifli
in the sugar.  Let cool on wire racks.  Repeat steps
with the remaining three quarters of dough.

Killer Triple Chip Brownies

cookies, deserts

1  butter; to grease the foil
16 tablespoon unsalted butter; softened
2 cup sugar
8 ounce bittersweet chocolate  melted and s; lightly cooled
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
4  eggs
1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped walnuts
2 cup semisweet chocolate
2 cup milk chocolate
2 cup butterscotch bits

PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Line an 8 3/4-by-13 1/2-inch
glass or metal pan with a large piece of aluminum
foil, smoothing it into the corners. Butter the foil.
In a large bowl, cream the butter with the sugar
together until it is light in color. Stir in the
melted chocolate. Add the vanilla, then add the eggs,
beating until blended. In another bowl, combine the
flour and salt. Add the walnuts and all the bits,
tossing to coat them with the flour. Scrape the flour,
nuts and bits into the bowl with the butter, and stir
with a wooden spoon just until all the ingredients are
mixed. Do not over-beat. Scrape the batter into the
prepared pan, holding the foil so that it does not
move. Place the pan in the middle of the oven and bake
until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out
almost clean, about 50 minutes. Remove the pan and let
it stand for an hour, then cover the pan with foil and
place it in your freezer for at least 1 1/2 hours or
in your refrigerator overnight. Turn the cooled
brownies out onto a clean workspace, lift off the foil
and cut into 32 squares. Store in the refrigerator or

Kisses #1

cookies

4  egg whites
1 pound confectioners sugar
1 teaspoon lemon juice
3/4 pound walnuts,broken into quarters

If you have egg whites left over from other recipes,
use them for making kisses. For the holidays you can
dress them up by sprinkling some green sugar or red
cinnamon hearts on each kiss to make them more festive.

Preheat oven to 250ø.

In a large bowl, beat egg whites until stiff; add
sugar and lemon juice. Continue beating on high speed
until mixture is very stiff (this takes a few
minutes). Stir in nuts.

With a teaspoon, place small mounds on a greased and
floured cookie sheet. Bake at 250ø for about 30
minutes. Kisses should be set, but not brown.

Variation: Substitute chocolate chips for walnuts.

Kolache Cookies

cookies, ethnic

2 cup flour
8 ounce cream cheese
1/2 pound butter
1  egg
2 teaspoon sugar
1  nut filling
1/2 pound ground walnuts
1  egg white, beaten
1 cup sugar or honey
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Sift the flour and sugar together. Work in the butter,
cream cheese and egg. Knead together. And easy way to
do this is to put the dough inside a plastic bag -
much less messy! Let the dough stand in the
refrigerator overnight. About a half hour before
you're ready to start making the cookies, put the
dough into the freezer.

For the filling, mix all of the above ingredients
together.  You can also used canned poppy seed filling
(Solo brand) or an apricot or prune filling.

Spread flour and powdered sugar onto the surface where
you will be rolling the dough. Roll the dough out
thin. Cut into squares about 2 inches on each side.
It's easiest to cut if you use a pizza cutter. Spread
a small amount of filling (1/2 to 1 teaspoon) from one
corner to the opposite corner. Don't fill them too
much, or the filling will spill out when it is
cooking. Fold the two remaining corners to the center,
partially covering the filling. Wet your fingertip in
a small bowl of water, and seal the edge, or it may
open up during the cooking.

Bake in a 375 degree oven for about 13 minutes.

Kolaches (Or Kolacky)

cookies, deserts

1 cup butter
1 cup creamed cottage cheese
2 cup flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
      Fruit filling (see below) ----pinea
1 cup (9 ounce can) crushed pineapple
1/3 cup sugar
      Cornstarch -----apricot filling----
1 cup chopped dried apricots
1/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoon butter
1/8 teaspoon cinnamon

These are very simple, but you will find NO better
cookie anywhere! On the down side, they do require
advanced preparation (overnight is best).   Included
are a couple of filling recipes, but a can of pre-made
will work too. (Apricot is best)   When rolling out
dough, try to keep it as chilled as possible. To cream
the cottage cheese, it helps if you have a food
processor or blender, but a fork and a strong arm will
do in a pinch.   Mix ingredients and chill at least 6
hours. Roll to 1/4" thickness. Cut into 2 or 3 inch
squares, and place filling or preserves in center of
square. Bring corners over filling and seal together.
Bake at 350 - 25 to 30 minutes. Remove and dust with
powdered sugar.   Pineapple Filling: Combine
ingredients in sauce pan, cook stirring constantly
until thickened. Cool.   Apricot Filling: Simmer
apricot 10 minutes. Add sugar and simmer 10 minutes
more. Remove from heat and add butter and cinnamon.
Cool.

Kolachki

cookies, holiday, russian

      ----COOKIE DOUGH----
1/2 pound cream cheese (at room temperature)
1/2 pound butter (at room temperature)
3 cup flour
1 single walnut filling, below or
12 ounce poppy seed filling (1 can)
      ----WALNUT FILLING----
1 pound walnuts, finely ground
1  egg
1 cup sugar
1  water

Mix butter and cream cheese until smooth.  Add flour and mix again until
smooth.  Making this dough is easy with a food processor, hard with a
mixer.

Roll dough into 3 balls.  Refrigerate dough to keep it from drying out. The
dough can be refrigerated for 1-2 hours, but it is not necessary. Roll out
1 ball at a time and flour lightly. Roll dough out in flour or granulated
sugar so it doesn't stick.

Cut dough into squares or circles using cookie or biscuit cutter.  Add
about a teaspoon of filling. Roll squares into "logs." Fold circles over
and seal with a fork. Bake at 375 degrees F. for 10-15 minutes or until
lightly browned.

MAKE FILLING:  Mix all ingredients together.  Add water to obtain a sticky
consistency.

NOTES:

*  Russian Cookies -- This recipe is from Mrs. Malinch, my little sister's
high school Russian teacher.  I usually make this recipe at Christmas or
Easter.

My favorite fillings are poppy seed and walnut.  A recipe for the walnut
filling is included.  The poppy seed filling can be found canned (Solo
brand) in either the gourmet or cake section of most grocery stores. Yield:
6    dozen Kolachki.

*  The kolachki are delicate, so do not throw them in a plastic bag or pile
high in a jar as you would cookies.  The kolachki can be frozen.

      ----APPLE FILLING----
4 each apples, sliced
3 tablespoon cinnamon candies
1/3 cup water

Dissolve yeast in lukewarm water. Scald milk and set
aside until lukewarm, not cold. Cream butter and sugar
until light and fluffy. Add salt and mix again. Place
dissolved yeast in milk. Add 3 cups flour and beat
well. Stir in the creamed mixture and beat again. Then
add unbeaten eggs and blend. Gradually add remaining
flour, a tablespoon at a time, until dough is smooth
enough to handle, then knead in remaining flour on a
warmed board. The dough should be smooth and elastic
to the touch, never hard nor stiff. Place in a greased
bowl, cover, and allow to stand in a warm place about
2 1/2 hours until double in bulk. Place dough on a
warmed board, which has been slightly floured. Pat
down dough to about 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into 2
inch squares. Place a teaspoon of filling (recipe
below) on each square and gather up the 4 corners
carefully, folding one on top of the other, and press
together so that folded dough is thinner than dough
beneath the filling. When folded correctly, the
filling will peek through the four sides. Place on a
large cookie sheet about 2 inches apart. Let rise
until double in bulk in a warm place, about 45
minutes. Bake at 375-F for 25 minutes. When cool
sprinkle generously  with powered sugar. Makes about
six dozen cakes. PRUNE FILLING:
Wash prunes and cook in enough water to cover. Bring
to boil. When cool, strain, pit and chop well. Sweeten
and add cinnamon to taste or orange peel. Allow to
cool slightly before spreading. POPPY SEED FILLING:
Combine ingredients and cook about five minutes until
thick. APPLE FILLING:
Cook together about five or six minutes until apples
are soft. Cool.

3/4 cup vegetable oil
3/4 cup superfine sugar
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 cup brandy
1 cup sesame seeds

Preheat the oven to 400F.

Combine the flour and cinnamon in a bowl and set aside.

In a medium bowl, beat the oil and sugar with an
electric mixer until smooth and creamy.  In a cup,
dissolve the baking powder and baking soda in the
brandy, then add to the oil mixture.

Gradually add the flour until the dough is soft but
not sticky.  Turn out onto a lightly floured surface
and knead until smooth.  Pinch off pieces of dough the
size of small walnuts and form into desired shapes.
Sprinkle with sesame seeds and place 1 inch apart on
greased cookie sheets. Bake for about 15 minutes, or
until golden brown.

Kourabiedes

cookies, christmas, greek

2 cup butter, unsalted
1 cup sugar, powdered
3  egg yolks
3 tablespoon brandy
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
6 cup flour
1/2 cup almonds (blanched), chopped
1 pound sugar, powdered (one package)

Beat the butter with the sugar until it becomes fluffy.  Add the egg yolks
one by one, beating continuously. Add the brandy and vanilla.

Blend in the almonds and the flour, a cup at a time.  Use enough flour to
get a firm dough (it may take a bit more or less than the amount mentioned
in the ingredients list). Use your hands to do the mixing, as an electric
mixer will be useless after the first two or three cups of flour have been
added. Place the dough in the refrigerator for at least one hour.

Shape the dough into balls, about one inch in diameter, flatten them and
place on greased cookie sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 20 minutes.

Remove from the oven.  Roll each cookie (while it is still hot) in the
powdered sugar and put it back on the cookie sheet.  Repeat this step once
more, so that you get a thicker coating.

Place the coated cookies on a platter, liberally sprinkling each layer and
the bottom of the platter with powdered sugar. When you are done, there
shouldn't be any sugar left. Let them cool and they are ready to eat!

NOTES:

*  Traditional Greek Christmas cookies coated with powdered sugar -- This
is one of the two kinds of confection that are traditionally consumed in
large quantities in Greece during the holiday season (the other is
melomacarona). As a quick lesson in greek, "kourabiedes" (pronounced
"kou-ra-bi-ETH-es", is the plural of the word "kourabies" (kou-ra-bi-ES).
Now all you need to enjoy them is the recipe. I got this one from a Greek
cookbook and translated it into English.

*  The cookbook suggests the following variations:  using ouzo or scotch
instead of brandy, and almond extract instead of vanilla extract, but I
have not tried any of them. Also, putting granulated instead of powdered
sugar in the dough didn't seem to affect the recipe, there's so much sugar
in it, that you couldn't tell the difference anyway.

*  The cookbook also suggested using twice the amount of sugar for coating.
This is obviously too much, but it should make you realize that you must
really be liberal with the sugar!

Kourambiedes

cookies

1 cup sweet butter
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1  egg yolk
2 tablespoon brandy or cognac (optional)
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 1/4 cup sifted cake flour; (or more)
3/4 cup ground almonds; toasted
1 pound powdered sugar; sifted

In electric mixing bowl, whip the sweet butter until
it is fluffy and white.  Continuing to beat on medium
speed, gradually add the 1/2 cup powdered sugar, egg
yolk, and flavorings.
Meanwhile, sift the baking powder with the flour
and gradually add to the batter, mixing by hand and
working the flour thoroughly into the mixture before
adding more.  Mix in ground almonds.  Knead until a
soft, buttery dough is formed that will stay together
when a little is rolled in the palms of your hands.
Break off pieces slightly larger than a walnut, then
roll into balls, half-moons, or S-curves.  Place on
cookie sheets allowing an inch between each.  Bake on
the center rack of a 350-degree oven for 12 to 15
minutes or until golden colored, not chestnut.  Remove
from the oven and carefully lift each Kourambie and
place on a generous layer of sifted powdered sugar.
Immediately sift more powdered sugar over to cover
Kourambiedes.  Allow to cool for 10 to 15 minutes
before lifting and rolling to be sure they are evenly
coated.  May be served in individual fluted paper
cups, with a bit of additional powdered sugar sifted
over tops.

Krong-Krang (Thai Fried Cookie).

cookies, thai

      ----DOUGH----
2 cup flour
1 each egg yolk
1/2 cup coconut cream *
3 tablespoon lime water (caco3 solution)
1  oil for frying
      ----SYRUP----
1 tablespoon cilantro roots, chopped fine
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup coconut sugar
2 tablespoon jasmine water (extract)

* Coconut cream is the rich heavier portion of coconut
milk, either from the first "pressing", or skimmed of
the top of coconut milk that's been set aside for
about an hour in the refrigerator. Sift the flour and
add egg yolk.  Knead the yolk into the flour while
slowly adding the coconut cream and lime water.  Knead
until the dough is soft and shiny.  Divide the dough
into small round balls, approximately 1 inch in
diameter. You may make it larger or smaller, if
desired. The dough ball is then "formed" onto a
grooved wooden form into a small thin sheet, with
"ridges" on one side.  Fry the formed dough in hot oil
till golden brown.  Drain well and set aside to cool
completely. In the meantime, add jasmine water to the
coconut sugar in a good size frying pan over a low
heat.  When the sugar is fully melted and combined
with the jasmine water, add the cilantro roots, salt,
and peppers that had been previously blended together.
Turn the heat up to medium and mix all the ingredients
well.  Continue to stir, preventing the syrup from
burning, until the syrup is "fragrant". Add the cooled
fried dough and distribute the syrup all over the
dough. Remove the coated dough pieces from the pan and
spread out to cool on a tray lined with waxed paper.
When cold, they may be stored in air-tight container.

Krumiri

cookies, italian

1 cup unsalted butter
2/3 cup sugar
3  egg yolks
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup yellow cornmeal

PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 325F. Beat the butter with the
sugar by hand, with a hand mixer set at medium speed,
or in a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the paddle.
Continue beating until the mixture lightens both in
texture and color, about 4 or 5 minutes. Beat in the
vanilla, then the yolks, one at a time, beating smooth
after each addition. Stir the flour and cornmeal
together, and stir into the butter mixture by hand.
Line 2 or 3 cookie sheets with parchment paper and
pipe the Krumiri in horseshoe or stick shapes, using a
pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch star tube (Ateco
#4). Bake about 15 minutes. Remove from pans and cool
on a rack. VARIATION OF KRUMIRI: SCHIACCATINE DI
GRANTURCO. These wonderful biscotti are always on the
bar at Tonino and Claudia Verro's charming inn,
Contea, at Neive, near Alba in Piemonte. The
surrounding area, known as the Langhe for its
situation in the Langa hills, has some of Italy's most
breathtaking natural scenary, as well as excellent
wine and Grappa. FOLLOW THE RECIPE FOR KRUMIRI, but do
not pipe the dough. Divide the dough in half and place
each half on a piece of parchment or wax paper. Shape
the dough into a rough log about 1-inch diameter and
about 6 inches long. Roll and tighten the paper around
the dough, to make it perfectly cylindrical. Chill the
cylinders of dough about 1 hour, until firm. Remove
one piece at a time from the refrigerator and slice
the cylinder into disks 1/4-inch thick. Arrange the
disks of dough on paper-lined cookie sheets, 1 inch
apart on all sides. Continue with the other cylinder
of dough. Bake as for the Krumiri.

Krumkake

cookies, deserts, norwegian

3  eggs
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract or
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1 dash ground nutmeg

In a medium mixing bowl beat eggs with an electric
mixer on medium speed about 1 minute.  Add sugar; beat
about 3 minutes or till sugar is almost dissolved.
Melt butter; cool slightly.  Stir butter into egg
mixture.  Add flour, vanilla or almond extract, and
nutmeg; stir just till smooth.
Heat a Krumkake iron on the range-top over
medium-low heat.  For a 6-inch iron, spoon about 1
Tablespoon of the batter onto the hot, ungreased iron.
Close gently but firmly.  Cook over medium-low heat
about 30 seconds or till light golden brown.  Turn
iron and cook about 30 seconds more.  Open the iron
carefully.  Loosen cookie with a narrow spatula;
invert onto a wire rack.  Immediately roll the cookie
into a cone or cylinder; using a wooden or metal form.
Let cool around the cone or cylinder till the cookie
holds its shape.
Reheat the iron and repeat with remaining batter.
Cool rolled cookies on a wire rack.  If desired,
before serving, pipe or fill with whipped cream; top
with chopped almonds or chocolate-flavored sprinkles,
or serve with preserves if desired.  Makes 26-30
cookies.

Krumkaker

cookies, deserts, norwegian

1 cup sugar
4  eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup butter
1 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch
3 tablespoon cold water

Using a stationary or hand-held mixer, beat together
the sugar, eggs, and vanilla until the mixture is
light and airy.

Melt the butter and let it cool.  Sift the cardamom
and flour together. Mix the cornstarch and water until
smooth. With the mixer on low speed, alternately add
the butter and flour to the sugar-egg mixture. Beat in
the cornstarch mixture.

Pour a spoonful of batter on a heated krumkaker iron,
press it shut, and bake the cookie until golden on
each side. Drape around a cone or in a cup until dry.

I like to serve these with whipped cream that has
cloud berries (multebaer) whipped into it.   Realizing
that cloud berries are hard to come by, my second
choice would be raspberries.

Melissa Mierau's notes:  It really foamed when the dry ingredients
were added to the wet, sort of like peanut brittle. Then with further
stirring it thickened up. They baked into a real nice cookie but only
made about 2 dozen (using teaspoon for scoop instead of ice cream
scoop). I will double recipe next time! From: Melissa Mierau Date:

Luxembourgli (Raspberry Filled Sandwich Cooki

cookies, swedish

1 1/4 cup blanched almond slices (about 4 oun; ces)
1 cup powdered sugar
1/2 cup egg whites (4 to 5), completely fre; e of yolk
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon (scant) almond extract
1  for the raspberry buttercream:
6 1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter, slightly softened
1 1/4 cup powdered sugar
1/3 cup seedless raspberry preserves or jam

FOR THE COOKIES:

Heat the oven to 325F.  Line 2 very large baking sheets (or 3 smaller
ones) with baking parchment. Toast the almonds in the oven, stirring
occasionally, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until tinged with brown. Set
aside to cool.  Reset the oven to 300F.

Grind the cooled almonds and 1/2 cup of powdered sugar in a food
processor until very fine but not oily. Thoroughly stir the remaining
powdered sugar into the almonds.

Combine the granulated sugar and 3 tablespoons of hot tap water in a
small heavy saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring just to a boil,
stirring. Cover the pan and boil for 1 1/2 minutes to allow the steam
to wasu the sugar crystals from the sides of the pan.  Uncover and
continue boiling, lifting the pan and swirling the contents
occasionally, but never stirring, for about 1 minute longer until the
syrup thickens, bubbles vigorously, and reaches the firm ball stage
(240 F on a candy thermometer). To test for doneness without a
thermometer, remove the pan from the heat and drop a small amount of
the syrup into a cup of ice water; let stand for 10 seconds.  The
syrup should form a firm ball when squeezed between the fingers.  Set
the syrup aside.

Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer on medium speed until
frothy. Add the cream of tartar, raising the mixer speed to high.
Continue beating just to soft peaks; turn off mixer. Return the syrup
to the burner and reheat just to simmering.  With the mixer on high
speed, immediately pour a thin, steady stream of syrup down the side
of the bowl (avoid the beaters or whip as the syrup will stick) until
all of the syrup is added. Add the vanilla and almond extracts.
Continue beating until the mixture cools to lukewarm.

Use a rubber spatula to fold the almond mixture evenly into the
beaten egg whites.  Immediately drop the mixture from small spoons
into 1-inch kisses spacing about 3/4 inch apart on the parchment
lined baking sheets. (Alternately, pipe the mixture into 1-inch
rounds using a pastry bag fitted with a plain or open star 3/8-inch
diameter tip.) Place the pans staggered on racks in the center half
of the oven.  Bake for 19 to 22 minutes, reversing pans from front to
back and switching racks about halfway through, until barely tinged
and firm on top but still slightly soft inside. Let the pans stand on
wire racks until the meringues are completely cooled.  Peel from the
paper.  Store aiftight until assembled.

To prepare the buttercream:  Beat togather the butter, powdered
sugar, and preserves until light and fluffy. Spread with a knife (or
pipe using a pastry bag and tibe) small amounts of the cream over the
flat sides of half the cookies.  Top with the r4emaining meringues,
pressing together tightly. Store the cookies airtight and
refrigerated for up to 24 hours; they will soften too much if left
longer.  (For longer storage, freze, tightly wrapped, for up to 2
weeks; thaw just before serving.) Allow the cookies to warm up
slightly before serving.

Makes about forty 1 1/4-inch sandwich cookies.

Mailanderli (Rolled Buttery Lemon Cookies)

cookies, swedish

1/2 cup butter, slightly softened (1 stick)
2/3 cup granulated sugar, plus more for gar; nishing
1 large egg
1  finely grated peel (yellow part onl; y) of 1 large
1  lemon
1 3/4 cup all-purpose or unbleached white flo; ur
1 large egg yolk beaten with 1 tablespoon w; ater
1  for glazing cookies.

Grease several baking sheets and set aside.  With a mixer at medium
speed, beat the butter in a large mixer bowl until light and fluffy.
Beat in the sugar until well blended and smooth. Beat in the egg and
lemon peel. With the mixer at low speed, beat in the flour just until
evenly incorporated.

Divide the dough in half.  Place each portion between large sheets of
waxed paper.  Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough to a scant 1/4
inch thick. Check the undersides and smooth out any wrinkles in the
waxed paper. Stack the rolled portions on a tray or baking sheet.
Refrigerate for about 20 minutes or until cold and firm, but not hard.

Heat the oven to 375F.  Working with one chilled portion of dough at
a time (keep the other one chilled), peel away a layer of waxed
paper. (This makes it easier to lift the cookies from the paper
later.) Replace the paper and turn the dough over. Peel of the second
layer of paper. Using a 2-inch round or scalloped cutter (or a small
juice of sherry glass) cut out the cookies.  Use a spatula to
carefully lift the cookies from the paper and place them about 1 inch
apart on the baking sheets. Reroll the dough scraps between waxed
paper; rechill in the refrigerator. Repeat the process with the
second portion of dough.

Working with a few cookies at a time, brush the tops with the egg
yolk-water mixture using a pastry brush or paper towel. Sprinkle the
tops lightly with granulated sugar. Repeat until all of the cookies
are garnished.

Bake the cookies for 6 to 9 minutes or until the top is just tinged
with brown and slightly darker at the edges. Let cool on the baking
sheets for about 2 minutes. Transfer to wire racks and let stand
until thoroughly cool.  Store airtight for up to a week. Freeze for
longer storage.

Makes 50 to 60 cookies.

Mama's Cookie-Covered Nuts

cookies

2 cup flour
1 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup butter, unsalted
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt
1  mixed nuts

Mix the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.  Cut in the butter. Add
the vanilla extract and a tiny amount of water SLOWLY to form a
heavy, thick dough.  (The amount of water varies by the amount of
humidity in the air; never a given in Florida!)

Shape dough into balls, and wrap around various types of nuts. Bake
at 275 degrees for 30 minutes.  (If you add too much water, the
cookie will flatten out with an obvious, single nut in the middle.
But they still taste good!)

Vicki's notes:

*  When my brother and I were young, Daddy made "surprise" biscuits
for a special breakfast.  They were just refrigerated dough, but he
would always sneak something into the middle, such as jam, peanut
butter, you never knew!  We adored the surprises, and I guess this
was my mother's way of doing the same thing...

Martha Stewart's Oatmeal Toffee Cookies

cookies

1 1/2 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup unsalted butter; room temperature
3/4 cup sugar
3/4 cup light brown sugar
1 1/2 cup oatmeal
1 each egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup dried cherries
1 cup bittersweet chocolate (4 1/2  ounce; s, coarsely chopped
1 cup skor toffee bits (5 1/2 ounces)

Martha Stewart always thought it would be difficult to improve on her
own oatmeal cookie recipe until she tasted Torie Hallock 92s
exquisite oatmeal cookies filled with toffee pieces, chocolate
chunks, and dried cherries. An outstanding baker and cook, Torie
lives in rural Maine and still manages to locate the finest and most
delicious ingredients to use in her cooking.

Torie 92s oatmeal-cookie dough can be baked immediately, refrigerated
for 1-2 days, and frozen for up to a month.

1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Sift together the flour and baking soda
and set aside. In an electric mixer, using a paddle attachment cream
the butter and sugars on medium high speed until light and fluffy,
about 2 to 3 minutes.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl one or twice
during mixing. Add egg; mix on high speed to combine. Add vanilla
extract; mix to combine. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.

2. Add the sifted flour in additions on a low speed until well
combined. On low speed, add the oatmeal, cherries, chocolate and
toffee pieces and mix to combine.

3. Divide the dough into three equal portions and roll into logs using
plastic wrap, approximately 1 1/2-inch in diameter. Dough can be
frozen, chilled in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 days or baked
immediately. Cut logs into 3/4-inch pieces. Bake on parchment-lined
baking sheets, until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the
oven, and transfer to a baking rack to cool.

Melomacarona

cookies, christmas, greek

1 1/2 cup olive oil
1/2 cup butter, unsalted (at room temperatu; re)
1 cup beer
3/4 teaspoon cinnamon, ground
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, ground
1  orange peel (use the grated peel of; one orange)
1 cup sugar
2 cup semolina, finely ground
6 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup sugar (for the syrup)
1 1/2 cup honey
1 cup water
1/2 cup walnuts, chopped

Put the olive oil, butter, beer, cinnamon, cloves, orange peel and sugar in
a mixing bowl and beat until they are thoroughly blended.

Sift about one cup of flour with the baking soda, baking powder and salt
and blend into the mixture. Add the semolina, a cup at a time, into the
mixture.

Add the enough of the remaining flour, a cup at a time, until you get a
rather firm dough (you may need a bit more or less than the amount
mentioned in the ingredients list). Use your hands to do the mixing, as an
electric mixer will be useless after the first two or three C of flour have
been added.

Roll the dough into cylinders, about two inches long and  one inch in
diameter, flatten them with your hands, and place them on cookie sheets
greased with a little olive oil.  Bake at 350 degrees F. for half an hour.
Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool for about half an hour.

Make the syrup:  mix the sugar, honey and water, and bring them to a boil.
Cook on low heat for three minutes and skim off the foam that forms on top.
Pour the hot syrup over the cookies, sprinkle them with the chopped walnuts
and let them soak overnight.

NOTES:

*  Traditional greek Christmas cookies soaked in honey syrup -- This is one
of the two kinds of confection that are traditionally consumed in large
quantities in Greece during the holiday season (the other is kourabiedes).
I suppose the name translates to something like "honey macaroons", except
that they are not really macaroons. I got the recipe from a greek cookbook.

*  You can use flour instead of semolina, but only as a last resort, as you
won't be able to get that wonderful grainy texture which you get if you use
semolina.

*  The amounts given here are for only half a recipe.  Considering that it
is very hard to eat only one melomacarono, making the full recipe may not
be as outrageous as it sounds!

: Difficulty:  Easy to moderate.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 30 minutes baking, 30 minutes cooling,
overnight soaking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

Melomakarona Andonias

cookies, greek

1  karen mintzias
7 cup all-purpose unbleached flour
1  extra flour for kneading
1 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cup mild olive oil
1 1/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup cognac or- mavrothaphne wine or- ru; by port
3  oranges; zested and juiced
4 teaspoon freshly ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground clove
3/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
      ----SYRUP----
1 pound honey; (1 lb = about 2 cups)
1 cup sugar
1  1-inch piece of cinnamon
1  clove
1  lemon; zested and juiced
1 cup water
      ----TOPPING----
1/2 cup shelled almonds
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon freshly ground cinnamon

Author's note: These cakes are traditionally served at Christmas. This
recipe comes from my neighbor, Andonia. I have a distinct memory of
her beating the oil and sugar into the flour until it dissolved using
her middle finger and forefinger as a beater - though a spoon will do.

Start by making the syrup.  Put the honey, sugar, cinnamon, clove, and
lemon zest in a saucepan and add the water. Bring to a boil and
simmer for 5-10 minutes. Add the lemon juice, then chill.

To blanch the almonds, plunge them into boiling water for 1-2 minutes,
until you see signs of their skins loosening. Then drain and slip or
pop them from their skins onto a baking sheet. Toast them in an oven
preheated to 350 F for about 10 minutes - just until they begin to
color. Cool, then chop them very, very finely - if you do this in a
food processor, make sure that the pulses are short, or the nuts
could turn oily. Mix the ground almonds with the sugar and cinnamon
and reserve.

Sift the flour, baking soda and salt together.  Put the olive oil and
sugar in a large bowl and beat together - with your fingers like
Andonia - or with a wooden spoon. Beat in the Cognac, the orange
zest, spices, and juice from 2 oranges (about 1/2 cup).

Then beat in the flour, a few spoonfuls at a time, until you have a
malleable dough, adding more flour if it is too soft, and more orange
juice if it is too stiff. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and
knead for 10-15 minutes until very smooth.

Pinch off pieces of dough of about 2 tablespons and form into
flattened oval or lozenge shapes.  Place them on an oiled or
non-stick baking sheet. Bake in an oven preheated to 400-425 F for
about 20 minutes, until brown.

When they are cool enough to handle, dip them in the bowl of syrup for
about 1 minute.  Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a tray to
cool. Sprinkle with the chopped almond mixture.

====================================================== ==== GLOSSARY
OF INGREDIENTS OF MEXICAN AND SOUTHWESTERN COOKING
======================================================= === ACHIOTE
SEED: The dried reddish seeds of the annatto tree give food a bright
orange-yellow tint when they are cooked first in hot fat; then, the
seeds themselves are discarded.  Sometimes they are ground to a
powder and stirred into such foods as butter for color. They impart a
flavor that is gentle and hard to describe; like that of saffron, it
has an earthy quality.
ADOBO:  A piquant sauce of tomato, vinegar and spices.
ANISE SEED:  This small, elongated seed tastes sharply of licorice.
ATOLE BLUE CORNMEAL:  This is blue corn that has been dried,
roasted, and ground specifically to be used in make ATOLE, a cornmeal
gruel.
Blue corn, unlike ordinary field corn, is always dried and ground
before use.  Cornmeal, blue, yellow, or white, can be used as a
thickener.
AVOCADO:  This fruit is ripe when the flesh under the leathery skin
yields to light pressure.  A hard avocado will ripen if left at room
temperature for two or three days. The Haas or California type is
smaller and darker green than the emerald type grown in Florida, and
some say it is more flavorful as well. Keep avocado flesh from
discoloring by brushing it with lemon juice as it is peeled.
BEANS:  It takes time to prepare dried beans, but the result is a
tender bean that is still firm.  Canned beans are sometimes mushy,
but they are convenient to keep on hand and are packed in liquid that
adds flavor to many recipes.  Dried beans keep almost indefinitely.
Before cooking dried beans, rinse them well and pick them over for
stones or inferior beans.
TYPES OF BEANS:
BLACK BEANS:  (frijoles negros, turtle beans) though small, have a
hearty flavor.  South American cooking makes great use of them.
With their dramatic dark purple-blue color, they lend themselves
nicely to garnishes.
BLACK-EYED PEAS:  (cowpeas) are the seeds of the cowpea, an annual
vine.  They are tan with a blackish stain, hence "black-eyed".
GARBANZO BEANS: (chickpeas) are Spanish in origin. These rounded
beige beans have a nutty flavor.
NORTHERN BEANS: are white, relatively large and mild.
PINTO BEANS: (frijoles) are charmingly speckled with brown on a
pale or pinkish background.
RED BEANS: are favorites in the southern states. Pinto beans may
be substituted.
BUFFALO:  This commercially raised red meat is lower in cholesterol
and fat than beef.  Unlike beef, it isn't marbled with fat.
Accustomed as we are today to tender cuts of meat, buffalo is best
enjoyed ground rather than steaks.
CAPERS:  These are the pickled, green buds from the prickly caper
bush. They are somewhat smaller than raisins and are bottled in brine.
CAYENNE:  See Chile.
CHAYOTE: (christophine, mirliton, vegetable pear): Related to gourds,
chayote squash have none of their brilliant decoration.
Light green skin encases firm flesh of an even paler green. Chayote
may be baked, steamed, stuffed and sauteed. A 1 pound Chayote makes a
nice serving for two or three people.
CHEESE:  Traditional Mexican cheeses were mad with goat's or sheep's
milk. The following cheeses are used in this style of cooking: TYPES
OF CHEESE:
CHEDDAR: is a mild firm cheese of English origin that becomes more
sharp with age.  It melts beautifully.
CHIHUAHUA: (Asadero Or Oaxaca) is white, creamy and tangy.
Sometimes it is sold braided.  Mozzarella or Monterey Jack may be
substituted.
CO-JACK: is an American invention.  Block cheese marbled with
Colby and Monterey Jack.
COLBY: is a slightly sharp cheese with a flavor similar to that of
Cheddar.  This American cheese has a rather soft open texture.
MONTERY JACK:  is a mild cheese usually sold in blocks. It
softens at room temperature.
QUESO ANEJO: is an aged, hard grating cheese.  It ranges from pale
cream to white in color and is quite salty. Romano or Parmesan
may be substituted.
QUESO FRESCO: (Ranchero seco) can be compared to a very salty
farmer's cheese.  A reasonable substitute for this crumbly cheese
is Feta Cheese.
SIERRA:  is another rather dry sharp cheese that grates easily.
Romano or Parmesan may be substituted.

CHILI:  Chilies are native to the Americas.  They have been known in
North America for some time but are said to have traveled north by a
circuitous route; apparently they found their way from Mexico to the
Western world with Christopher Columbus, then to the East and finally
back to North America.  New strains of chilies are developed
frequently, bred for hardiness, sweetness, hotness and so forth.  But
chilies are full of surprises; two chilies picked from the same plant
may vary widely in hotness.  To quench the fire of a too-spicy
mouthful, do not reach for a water glass.  Water will only spread the
capsaicin (the compound that our tongues register as "hot") around.
Instead, take a large mouthful of something starchy; corn chips,
beans, bread or rice.  Sometimes finding fresh chilies is difficult.
This probably isn't a question of distribution, but of perishability.
Canned and dried chilies are usually available.
The Following is a short list of peppers and what they are.
TYPES OF PEPPERS:
ANAHEIM CHILIES: (California Green Chilies) are slim between five
and eight inches long and of various light shades of green. these
mildly hot chilies are sometimes twisted in appearance. They are
occasionally stuffed, but their flesh is thin and more fragile
than that of the poblano chilies. The Anaheims cultivated in New
Mexico-- where the name is Chili Verde--are reputedly hotter. A
ripe red Anaheim is sometimes known as a chili Colorado. Anaheim
chilies are dried and tied in wreathes (ristras) and ground and
blended in commercial chili powder mixtures.  They may be
purchased in cans as "mild green chilies".  These chilies were
named after the town that at the turn of the century, was the site
of a chili cannery.
ANCHO refers to a ripened, dried poblano chili.
CASCABEL CHILIES:  True ones are scarcer than hens' teeth in most
parts of the United States.  Sometimes dried Anaheim Chilies are
labeled "cascabel," but they are very different from the authentic
item.  Fresh cascabel chilies are hot and have a distinctive
flavor. They are round and 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Dried, the
cascabel chili has a nutlike flavor.
CAYENNE CHILIES: are thin and tapered, three to seven inches long.
Dark green (unripe) or bright red (ripe), the cayenne is
incendiary and well known to Asian kitchens.  The red ones are
dried and ground to make cayenne pepper ("ground red pepper").
This product adds heat and just a little chili flavor.
CHIPOTLE CHILIES: are smoked, dried Jalapenos with a very wrinkled
appearance.  Fresh jalapenos are vibrant green but they turn brown
when smoked. Chipotles can be purchased loose (dry) or canned in
Adobo sauce.  The canned variety is especially convenient as it
saves having to soak and soften them.
GUAJILLO CHILIES: (Mirasol Chilies) have a vegetal flavor that
shines even though the drying process.  Guajillos are orange-red,
skinny and about two to three inches long.
JALAPENO CHILIES: range from hot to very hot. They are dark
green, fat and about two to three inches long with a
characteristically rounded tip.  Watch out for the little ones,
which are the hottest.  Jalapenos ripen to red. Use them fresh or
pickled.
PASILLA CHILIES: are hot and brown (almost black when dried, which
is how they are commonly found.)  They have a dusky flavor.
POBLANO: is the chili most frequently used for CHILIES RELLANOS.
It is a suave dark green and ranges from mild to hot. Shaped like
a long bell pepper, the poblano has a nice shape for stuffing.
RED PEPPER FLAKES: are just that; flaked, dried ripe chilies. Most
red pepper flake mixtures are quite hot.
SERRANO CHILIES: are a sort of middling green, developing to
brilliant red when ripe.  Extremely hot (as hot as any chili),
this chili is usually shorter and thinner than the jalapeno.

GROUND RED PEPPER:  From ground dried cayenne chilies, this is often
called "cayenne pepper".  See Chili, Cayenne.
GUAVA:  These yellow-green fruits with pale faintly pink flesh are
about the size of a plum.  They are intensely fragrant when ripe.
Guava paste is only one of the fruit pastes beloved of Hispanics,
often served with cream cheese as dessert. The fruit is cooked with
sugar until thick, then canned or shaped into blocks.
HOMINY:  These corn kernels have been soaked and lightly cooked so
that the outer coating can be removed.
INSTANT CORN FLOUR TORTILLA MIX (MASA): This commercial product is
the shortcut in making fresh corn tortillas. It is fresh corn MASA
that has been dried and ground.
JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE (Sunchoke)  This knobbed root keeps well in the
refrigerator or other cold place. Jerusalem artichokes discolor after
peeling.  Dip them in acidulated water as the flesh is exposed.
Enjoy Jerusalem artichokes ray in salads, or broiled, sauteed,
mashed or in a gratin.
JICAMA:  The flesh of the jicama root is often compared to that of
the water chestnut, both for flavor and crunch. Jicama is related to
the sharp-tasting turnip but is so mild in flavor that, when eaten
raw, it is usually sprinkled with lemon or lime juice and chili
powder. After the brown fibrous skin has been pared away, jicama
flesh does not discolor. Look for smallish jicama, which will be
sweet and moist.
JUNIPER BERRIES:  The fruit of an ever green, juniper berries give
gin its distinctive flavor.  They are sometimes used to flavor game
dishes. These blue-green berries are purchased dried.  Add them
(sparingly) whole to saucy foods for subtle flavor or slightly
crushed for more impact.
LARD: This has been perhaps the most frequently used cooking fat
south of the boarder since it was introduced by the Spaniards. For
tender, flaky pastries, lard can't be beat.  It is little known that
lard, for all its reputation, has approximately half the cholesterol
of butter.
MANGO:  The skin of this oval fruit is washed in gold, pink, red, and
parrot green.  The flesh is deep yellow, juicy and richly perfumed.
Mangoes have flat, oval pits.  To slice the fruit, free it from the
pit in large pieces.
MASA:  Literally "dough" in Spanish.  MASA is cornmeal dough made
from dried corn kernels that have been softened in a lime (calcium
hydroxide) solution, then ground. Fresh MASA is commercially
available in Mexico, but it is tricky to work with and dries out
quickly. MASA comes finely ground, for tortillas, and coarsely ground
for tamales. It is easier to use instant corn flour tortilla mix when
making tortillas.
NOPALES:  These leaves of the prickly pear (nopal) cactus are firm
crunch pads.  Let size be your guide in buying them; the smaller the
pad, the more likely it is to be tender. Use tweezers to remove
spines, a sharp paring knife or vegetable peeler to remove their
bases. With a flavor similar to green beans, NOPALES are eaten both
raw and cooked.
NUTS:  In southwest cooking, nuts are sometimes ground and stirred
into sauces as a thickening agent. In addition to giving the sauce
more body, raw nuts add, of course, their own particular flavor.
Toasted nuts are more often used as a garnish or in baking.
TOASTING NUTS:  Toasting enhances the flavor of the nut. To
toast nuts, spread them in a single layer in an ungreased pan;
bake at 350 degrees F, stirring and checking for doneness
frequently.  Nuts are toasted when they are lightly browned. Let
almonds, pecans and walnuts bake for 7 to 12 minutes. Pine nuts
toast more rapidly, in 5 to 7 minutes.
TO GRIND NUTS:  To grind nuts, place 1/3 to 1/2 cup at a time in
the workbowl of a food processor or blender. Process them in
short pulses just until ground (longer and you will have nut
butter).
PAPAYA:  A nearly oval fruit with creamy golden yellow skin, orange
yellow flesh and scores of shiny black seeds conveniently packed in
its center. When slightly underripe, the flesh is firm (perfect for
making into relishes); When ripe, it is so juicy as to be almost
melting.
PECAN:  This oil-rich nut is an American native.  See Nuts for
toasting and grinding.
PEPITA:  See Pumpkin Seed PEPPER: There is PIPER NIGRUM, Peppercorn,
and the CAPSICUM FRUTECENS and CASPSICUM ANNUUM, the family of
vegetables know variously as peppers and chilies. Peppercorns came to
the Western world originally from Madagascar. The success of medieval
spice traders made black pepper more widely available and only a
little less precious than it had previously been.
Representing the FRUTESCENS contingent, bell peppers are related to
chilies but lack the capsaicin (the compound that makes them hot),
Bell peppers are therefore known as "sweet". Until recently, bell
peppers of any color than green were an oddity at many markets;
today, there is a profusion of yellow, red and purple ones. Red and
yellow are acknowledged to be the sweetest. Roast bell peppers as for
chilies.

PHEASANT:  This game bird fares equally well when cooked with a
bravely seasoned sauce or a mild creamy one. Serve it with a grain
side dish; see Game.
PILONCILLO:  This unrefined sugar is purchased in hard cones. Like
other "raw" sugars, piloncillo is beige to brown; the deeper the
color, the more pronounced the molasses flavor.
PINE NUTS (PINIONS, PIGNOLIS):  Pine nuts are the seeds of the Pinion
pine.  They are delicious raw or toasted. Store them tightly covered
and either refrigerated or frozen, depending on how quickly they are
to be used.  See NUTS for toasting and grinding.
PLANTAIN:  This relative of the banana boasts a thick skin and large
size. The fruit itself tends to be a deeper yellow than that of the
banana. Cooked unripe plantain is eaten as one would a potato.
Plantains are sweetest when ripe, which isn't until their skins are
an alarming through black.  Like bananas, plantains will ripen after
they have been harvested.
POSOLE:  Sometimes hominy is called "posole," but the word
authentically refers to a dish made with hominy as an ingredient. See
Hominy PRICKLY PEAR:  This is the diminutive (egg size) fruit of the
cactus of the same name.  It is nearly impossible to avoid the
prickles when peeling to reveal the garnet-colored flesh.  Prickly
pears are sometimes sold with the prickles removed.
PUMPKIN SEED:  With the shells or husks removed, pumpkin seeds are
known as PEPITAS.  Store them in a cool, dry place. To toast pumpkin
seeds, spread them in a single layer in an ungreased pan. Bake at 350
degrees F. for 13 to 15 minutes, stirring and checking for doneness
frequently.
QUAIL:  These little birds weigh in at about 1/4 pound. They have
richly flavored meat, what there is of it. Quail are most commonly
available frozen.  See GAME.
QUESO:  Spanish for "cheese." QUESO ANEJO: The name means "aged
cheese" in Spanish. See CHEESE.
QUESO FRESCO:  The name means "fresh cheese" in Spanish. See CHEESE.
RABBIT:  Rabbits are raised commercially.  As with many uncommon
meats, it is said of rabbit, that it "tastes like chicken." It
doesn't; it tastes like rabbit. Large rabbits aren't as tender as the
little ones; it is well to marinate or stew older ones, or make
rabbit sausage. See GAME.
RED PEPPER:  See Ground Red Pepper.
RED PEPPER SAUCE:  This commercially bottled condiment is made from
vinegar, spices and hot chilies. It adds heat but little in the way of
flavor.
RICE:  Mexican cooking calls for long grain or medium-grain white
rice. The occasional southwestern dish uses wild rice, which really
isn't rice. It is the fruit of an aquatic grass once harvested only
by Native Americans who lived by the Great Lakes.
SQUASH BLOSSOMS:  Contrary to poplar belief, the blossoms used in
southwest cooking are those of winter squashes such as pumpkin, not
zucchini.  They are a perishable item and are best used the day they
are bought.
TAMARIND:  This is an intensely pungent, tart pod about four inches
long. Tamarind is usually bought packaged in a tightly compressed,
sticky plastic-wrapped lump.  The flesh is riddled with fibers and
seeds--not what you want in your food--and must be soaked before
using. Separate the tamarind pods, pulling away and discarding as
much of the pod as you reasonably can.  Cover with water and let the
pulp soak for at least an hour (overnight, if time permits). Then
squeeze the pulp well to extract the juice or rub as much pulp as you
can through a fine mesh sieve.
TEQUILA:  A pale, sharp-tasting liquor distilled from the agave
plant, which thrives in an arid, hot climate. The stem of the agave,
known also as the "century plant," is used in making both PULQUE and
tequila.

TOMATILLO:  These fat little vegetables are the size of robust cherry
tomatoes.  They grow in papery husks reminiscent of Japanese lanterns
and taste best when they are a brilliant green in color. By the time
they begin to turn yellow, they have lost some of their acid
freshness. This happens when they are lightly cooked too, but then,
although they relinquish their vibrant color, the develop a gentler
flavor and become more luscious. Uncooked, chopped tomatillos are the
basis for chunky green salsas. Select tomatillos with their husks
still drawn tightly around them. Husk and rinse off the sticky
residue before using them.
TOMATO:  Roasting tomatoes gives them a faintly mysterious flavor. It
works best with truly ripe red tomatoes.
TO ROAST TOMATOES:  To roast and peel tomatoes, set the oven
control to broil.  Arrange cored tomatoes with their top surfaces
about 5 inches from the heat.  Broil, turning occasionally, until
the skin is blistered and evenly browned, about 5 to 8 minutes.
The skins will be easy to remove.  If the tomatoes are roasted on
aluminum foil, the cleanup will be easy and you'll be able to save
any juice they give off as they roast.
TORTILLA:  Tortillas are round, flat unleavened breads made from
ground wheat or corn.  They are the basis of Mexican cookery.
Tortillas are rolled, folded, used as dippers, fried crisp and
munched fresh.  Corn tortillas are cut into wedges and fried for
chips. For the best chips, fry tortillas that are at least one day
old. Flour tortillas, softer than those made from corn, are more
popular in northern Mexico where corn does not flourish; wheat was
brought there by the Spanish. Commercially made tortillas of both
kinds are best stored in the freezer until needed.
To soften tortillas, warm them on a hot ungreased skillet or griddle
for about 30 seconds to 1 minute. They can be warmed in a 250 degree
oven for 15 minutes. Or, wrap several in dampened microwaveable paper
toweling or microwave plastic wrap and microwave on high (100% Power)
for 15 to 20 seconds.
TRIPE:  Usually what is meant by tripe is the line of pig and sheep
stomachs.  Tripe is the identifying ingredient of traditional MEMUDO,
a hearty soup. Tripe needs to be thoroughly rinsed often, in three or
four changes of cold water, before it can be used.
VENISON:  Venison is deer meat.  Because it is lean, venison needs
moist heat to keep it tender.  See GAME.
WALNUTS:  The flavor of this nut is delicious with corn. See NUTS for
toasting and grinding.

though everyone seems to agree that it comes from the town of Nanaimo, in
British Columbia.

Neapolitan Biscotti

cookies

1 1/2 cup whole almonds
2 cup all purpose flour
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/3 cup honey
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 large egg
1 large egg yolk
1 teaspoon finely grated orange peel

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 F. Line large
baking sheet with foil. Butter foil. Finely grind 3/4 cup almonds in
processor. Transfer to large bowl. Add flour, sugar, baking powder,
baking soda and cinnamon. Whisk honey, oil, egg, yolk and orange peel
in small bowl to blend. Add to dry ingredients and stir until dough
just begins to hold together (if dough seems firm and dry, let stand
10 minutes to soften). Turn out dough onto lightly floured work
surface. Add remaining 3/4 cup almonds and knead to distribute
evenly. Divide dough in half. Roll each half into 12-inch-long,
2-inch-wide log. Place logs on prepared sheet, spacing 4 inches
apart. Bake until firm to touch and dark brown (logs may crack),
about 40 minutes. Cool logs on sheet on rack 15 minutes. Transfer
logs to work surface. Using serrated knife, cut logs diagonally into
1/2-inch-thick slices. Place cut side down on same foil-lined sheet
and bake until light brown and dry, about 12 minutes. Cool on sheet
on rack. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Store airtight at room
temperature.) These not-too-sweet cookies are based on an old recipe
seldom seen these days. Although the combination of almonds, honey
and cinnamon is still a typical one, contemporary Neapolitan biscotti
tend to be less aggressively flavored.

Nicky's Favourite Shortbread

cookies, christmas

1 cup unsalted butter (room temp.)
1/2 cup icing sugar
2 cup all purpose flour*
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1  slivers of glaced cherries

* 1 3/4 c if measured before sifting

Cream butter and sugar together until silky.  Add sifted dry
ingredients and mix until blended, but just. Turn out on a lightly
floured pastry cloth, and with lightly floured hands, gather into one
lump. (This may appear sloppy and maybe hopeless.  As in pastry, you
will go wrong if you are too heavy handed or afraid of it!) Toss it
just a bit to get it to lump and pat out into a square about 1/3 inch
thick; square off your edges with a large knife or spatula, smooth
with a stocking rolling pin and cut into 1 inch squares. Place
slightly apart on ungreased cookie sheet with a sliver of cherry on
each.  Bake at 350 degrees for 15 to 18 minutes. They should be just
pale brown on bottom. WATCH IT, THEY BURN VERY EASILY. Remove gently
please, they are still having birth pangs; place to cool on trays
covered with waxed paper. Store in cans, they keep for weeks in a
cool place, and their flavour mellows.

1 cup honey
1/2 cup sweet butter, melted
1 each box fillo dough
1 pound walnuts, chopped

remaining 7/8 of honey syrup over nut mix to moisten. Lay fillo dough
on cutting board lengthwise.  Brush one layer at a time with melted
sweet butter (unsalted) until you have 3 layers. Line up a 1/4-inch
wide strip of nut mix along edge of dough about 1/4-inch thick. Pick
up that edge and roll dough into a cylinder with nut mix in the
center. Cut each cylinder into 8 pieces and place in 9 x 13-inch

Oreo Cookies

cookies, deserts

18 ounce pkg devil's food cake mix
2  eggs
2 tablespoon water
2 tablespoon cooking oil
1/2 cup bitter cocoa powder
1  envelope unflavored gelatin
1/4 cup cold water
1 cup crisco
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 pound plus 1 cup powdered sugar

Blend all COOKIE DOUGH ingredients together until you can shape the
dough into a smooth ball.  Let it stand 20 minutes, loosely covered.
Form dough into marble-sized balls. Place 2 inches apart on greased
cookie sheet. Flatten each with smooth bottom of a drinking glass
greased once and dipped into Nestles' Quick Powder. (Or use sweetened
chocolate drink powder). Bake at 400 degrees for 8 minutes.  Remove
cookies at once from baking sheet, to paper toweling and at once,
flatten each cookie with back of pancake turner.  Let cool 20
minutes.  Fill with COOKIE FILLING mixture. (Cookie Filling) Soften
gelatin in cold water. Place in heatproof cup in pan of hot water
till gelatin is transparent.
Meanwhile beat Crisco till fluffy, adding vanilla and sugar a little
at a time.  Beat in Gelatin mixture when it is completely cooled, but
not yet "set" or firm. This is used to give the filling stability -
as well as protein!  When cooled, shape filling into 1 inch balls.
Place between the two bottom sides of the cooled cookies, pressing
gently till filling has spread to edge of cookies and rounded-out
like the originals. This is suppose to be a great imitation version
of the original Nabisco Oreos.

Rugala  *** (Kxtg24b)

cookies, deserts, jewish

1 single filling:
1 cup ground pecans
1 cup currants
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 single dough:
8 ounce cream cheese; room temperatu
2 cup all purpose flour
1 cup butter; room temp.
2 tablespoon sugar
1 single flour
12 ounce jar apricot jam

For filling: combine pecans, currants, sugar and cinnamon in mixing
bowl. For dough: combine cream cheese, flour, butter and sugar in
processor or mixer and blend well. Divide dough into 4 pieces. Dust
each with flour, shaking off excess. Roll each piece between sheets
of waxed paper into 10" circle. Refrigerate 1 hour. Preheat oven to
375. Grease baking sheets. Spread each circle of dough with apricot
jam. Divide filling among circles, spreading evenly. Cut each into 12
wedges. Roll up each wedge from bottom to point. Arrange on prepared
sheets, point side down. Bake until golden, about 16-17 minutes.
Transfer to wire rack and let cool. Store cookies in airtight
container. Tips: Be sure to work on just one circle at a time and
keep others refrigerated. Don't overdo the jam and cinnamon/pecan
filling because they tend to overflow and will burn quickly on your
baking sheets. Remove at once from the baking sheet to cool on racks
when they turn golden brown on top. After rolling out between waxed
paper, one hour of cooling is perfect to cut out, but they may be
made ahead and refrigerated longer. Just leave them out a bit before
cutting out so dough won't be so stiff to handle properly and roll
well. P.S. I loved the directions, and the results. You know success
when others ask for the recipe.

cookies, deserts, diabetic

1/2 cup vegetable shortening
1 1/4 cup sugar
2  eggs, (large)
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 teaspoon lemon extract
3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon nutmeg; (optional)
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup sour cream

Cream shortening and sugar together at medium speed until well
blended. Add eggs and flavorings, and beat at medium speed until
creamy, scraping down the bowl before and after adding eggs and
flavorings. Stir flour, nutmeg if desired, baking powder, baking soda
and salt together to blend well; add, along with sour cream to
creamy. Cover and refrigerate from 3 hours to overnight. Return dough
to room temperature. Roll out on a lightly floured board to 1/4"

below). Place dough on cookie sheets that have been sprayed with pan
spray or lined luminum foil.  Bake at 350 for 8 to 10 minutes, or
until cookies are lightly browned. Remove them to a wire rack and
cool to room temperature.
NOTE: Nutritive values for these cookies are based on the use of
the 2 1/2 round cutter and weight of a little over 1 ounce per
cookie. You may use other cutters as long as the finished cookie
weighs about 1 ounce per cookie, and you might even make a 2-ounce
cookie and figure the nutritive value and exchanges as twice those
for the smaller cookie. You may add flavorings other than vanilla and
lemon; if add nuts, raisins and the like, however, you are altering
the nutritve values and exchanges for each cookie.

Sugar Cookie Dough For Molding

cookies, deserts

3/4 cup powdered sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1  egg yolk
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 1/2 cup flour

Cream butter and sugar at low speed. Add egg yolk and vanilla.
Continue to beat until smooth. Add flour and continue to beat on low
speed. Dough will seem very dry, it will moisten as it is mixed.
gather dough into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap and chill for 1 to 2
hours. Bake at 375 deg f for 10 to 12 minutes. Makes 4-5 cookies.
NOTE::Form cookies as follows: 1. Mix dough and chill. 2. Lightly oil
mold using pastry brush or cooking spray. 3. Blot out excess. 4. Dust
mold with flour. Knock out excess by tapping mold on hard surface
like a cutting board. 5. Using heel of hand press dough into mold. 6.
Level dough with a knife or spatula, using a sawing motion. 7. To
remove dough from mold, rap the mold against a protected surface ( a
cutting board covered with a towel works well). Hold mold upright and
rap the mold sharply against the board 2 to 3 times. As the dough
begins to fall out, catch with hand and lay on ungreased cookie
sheet. If dough does not come out, rotate mold and rap the other
side. 8. Mold remaining dough, but do not re-oil mold.

Sugar Cookies

cookies

1 cup butter, softened
1 cup salad oil
1 cup sugar, powdered (sifted if it is lu; mpy)
1 cup sugar
2  eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
4 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1  extra sugar (for dipping)

Cream the butter and sugars, then add oil and mix well.  Add the eggs and
vanilla and mix well.

Sift the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar and salt together, then add to
above and mix well.  Refrigerate overnight, or until dough is firm. If you
want to speed this up, put the dough in the freezer, but keep an eye on it.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Drop dough in 1/2 teaspoon amounts on an
ungreased
cookie sheet.  Dip a glass in dough and wipe excess off. Then dip the glass
in sugar and flatten a cookie. Repeat the dip-in-sugar flatten-cookie
sequence until all are done.  The cookies won't spread in baking, so you
can easily judge how far apart to put them (you want room to cook, but not
to grow). If you find that the dough is getting too soft to flatten easily,
put it in the refrigerator between batches.

Bake for about 5-6 minutes, until the edges are JUST beginning to turn
golden brown. Take off the cookie sheet and put on waxed paper or foil to
cool.

NOTES:

*  Delicate and buttery sugar cookies.

*  You can add 2-3 tablespoon cocoa to about 1 1/2 cups dough for chocolate
cookies,
or add cinnamon to the dipping sugar for spice cookies. I like the sugar
cookies plain, so I've never actually tried this.

*  These cookies don't freeze well, because they pick up the flavors of the
other things in the freezer.  Make only as many as you can eat before they
go stale.

Triple Chocoloate Biscotti

cookies, deserts

1 3/4 cup hazelnuts -- (9 ounce)
2 2/3 cup flour, unbleached -- (10.5
1  oz)
1 cup cocoa, dutch-process -- (3.5
1  oz)
1 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cup sugar
1 1/2 tablespoon dark roasted coffee (or
1  instant espesso) -- finely
1  ground
2/3 cup chocolate chips -- (4 ounce)
5 large eggs
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
12 ounce white chocolate

I've used walnuts every time I've made these.

Heat the oven to 325.  Toast the hazelnuts on baking sheet for 10 to
15 minutes, until they emit a nutty aroma but haven't turned dark
brown inside.   If they still have skins, cover the nuts with a
dishtowel or paper towels for a few minutes after you take them out
of the oven and then rub the nuts with thetowel to remove the skins.
Set aside to cool.

Put the flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt, sugar, and coffee into the
bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle. Combine these
ingredients on a medium-low speed and then toss in the nuts and
chocolate chips. In a separate bowl, lightly whisk together the eggs
and vanilla extact. With the mixer running on low speed, slowly add
the egg mixture to the mixing bowl until the dough comes together.
Remove the bowl from the mixer and mix in any remaining dry
ingredients from the bottom by hand.

Divide the dough into four equal parts.  With floured hands, roll
each part into a log about 10 inches long and 2 inches in diameter.
Place the logs 4 inches apart on greased or parchment lined baking
sheets.

Bake the logs at 325 for 30 to 35 minutes, until the sides are firm,
the tops are cracked and the dough inside no longer looks wet. Remove
the baking sheets from the oven and reduce the temparature to 300.
Let the logs cool on the baking sheet for at least 10 minutes before
slicing the logs on a slight diagonal into 3/4 inch slices. Place the
biscotti flat on the baking sheet and dry them in the oven for about
25 minutes, until the biscotti offer resistance when pressed.
Transfer the biscotti to a rack to cool.

While the biscotti are cooling, chop the white chocolate and melt ina
microwave on low power or in a double boiler. With a knife, spread
white chocolate on one cut side of each cooked biscotti. Put the
biscotti, white-chocolate side down, on a parchment-lined baking
sheet. Allow the chocolate to harden. Peel the biscotti from the
parchment and store in an airtight container.

cookies, ice cream

2  egg whites
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup all purpose flour
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
2 teaspoon water
1 teaspoon vanilla
1  ice cream, sherbert, or fresh fruit; for filling

sheets. Using a six inch plate, trace two circles on each
sheet,leaving one inch between each circle. In large bowl, whisk
together egg whites, sugar, flour, butter, water and vanilla just
until blended. Using three tablespoons batter for each cookie, drop
on to circles on prepared baking sheet. With metal spatula, gently
spread batter as thinly as possible to fill circles.  Bake one sheet
at a time in upper half of 400 F oven for 6-8 minutes or until edges
are just beginning to brown. Remove baking hseet from oven and place
on rack. Using metal spatula, immediately lift one cookie and place
on to lightly greased inverted tall glass about 1-1/2 inches in
diamter. Working quickly,lightly shape warm cookie with fingers to
creat fluted effect.  Let cool completely on glass. Repeat with
remaining cookies. If cookie is too firm to mould, return to oven for
15-30 seconds or until softened. (Cookie shells can be stored in
airtight container for up to two day. Recrisp in 275F oven for one
minutes.

TIP:  It is important to work quickly when shaping tulip shells
because they're easiest to handle while still warm. If possible, line
baking sheets with parchment paper for easy removal of the cookies.

Walnut Crescents #2

cookies

1 3/4 cup flour
1/3 cup sugar
1 1/4 cup ground walnuts
2  egg yolks
1 cup sweet butter
1  confectioners sugar

Legend has it that bakers started making pastry in the form of
crescents following the Turkish siege of Vienna in 1683.

Preheat oven to 350ø.

In a large bowl, mix flour, sugar and ground walnuts. Make a little
well in the flour mixture and add the egg yolks. Cut butter into
small pieces and add to the flour mixture. Knead thoroughly and shape
into a ball. Add flour, if needed, to prevent the dough from sticking
to the bowl.

Cut the ball in 4 parts and shape each part in a roll about inch
thick. Cut 1/4-inch pieces and form small crescents in the palm of
your hand. Place crescents on a greased baking sheet and bake about
9-10 minutes, until light brown.

While still warm, roll the crescents in the confectioners sugar (be
careful, they break very easily), then place them on a board to cool.
Store in a cookie tin. The flavor actually improves with time.

Walnut Horns

cookies, holiday

2 cup flour
1 cup butter
8 ounce sour cream
1  egg yolk
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup walnuts, ground
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, ground
1  butter

Cream the flour and butter.  Mix in the sour cream and the egg yolk.

Divide the dough into four parts, wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for
several hours.

Mix together the brown sugar, walnuts and cinnamon.

Roll each dough section on a floured surface until about 1/8 inch thick.
Spread about 1/4 of the sugar/walnut/cinnamon mixture over each rolled
dough section. Cut the dough into pie-shaped wedges and roll, beginning at
the wide end.

Place cookies on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Brush with melted butter
(about 2 tablespoon should be enough). Bake for about 20 minutes at 375
degrees F.
If you remove the cookies from the oven before they turn brown, the dough
will be softer and flakier. If you remove them after they have browned
slightly, the dough will be crisper.

Remove cookies from cookie sheet before they have cooled completely, or
else they stick to the cookie sheet.

NOTES:

*  Rolled, walnut-filled cookies -- This recipe has been in the family for
a while. These cookies make great Christmas gifts.

*  During my childhood, these cookies tasted wonderful.  However, now they
strike me as a bit sweet.  You could probably decrease the amount of brown
sugar by 1/4 to 1/2 and make up for the loss in volume by increasing the
amount of nuts.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  Initial preparation:  10 minutes; chilling:  at least 2 hours;
final preparation:  20 minutes; baking:  20 minutes.
: Precision:  Measure the dough ingredients.

Zucchini-Spice Squares

cookies

1  egg
4 tablespoon unsalted (sweet) butter
1/4 cup honey
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup grated zucchini
1 cup whole wheat pastry flour, minus 2 t; ablespoons
2 tablespoon wheat germ
2 tablespoon soy flour or flour made from dried; garbanzo sprouts*
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ginger
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 cup chopped nuts

....Sprouting the garbanzo beans causes an explosion of nutrients and
the development of vitamin B12, which is very rare in vegetables. The
flour...makes these low-calorie confections in a high-energy food. The
combination of grains and beans greatly enhances the biological value
of the protein.

Preheat oven to 350F.

In food processor, blender, or mixing bowl, blend egg, butter, honey,
and vanilla until smooth and creamy. Add the zucchini and mix to
combine. In a bowl, combine flour, wheat germ, soy or garbanzo bean
flour, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg.  Mix to blend
ingredients. Stir in the nuts.

Spread the batter in a 9-inch-square baking dish, lined with parchment
paper or greased with a few drops of liquid lecithin and oil.

Bake for 30 minutes.  Cut into 1 1/2-inch squares.

Approximately 65 calories each.

*SPROUTED GARBANZO BEAN FLOUR:  Soak 1/2 cup garbanzo beans in about
2 cups of water overnight.  Next morning, pour off the water. (Save
it and use it in soup--it contains valuable vitamins and minerals.)
Rinse the beans and spread them out in a colander. Dampen a dish
towel or two layers of paper towels, and place over the beans. Slip
the whole thing into a plastic bag to retain moisture, but leave it
open at one end to ensure a source of oxygen.

Remove the covering and rinse the beans several times a day. In two or
three days, you will have sprouted garbanzos.

To make the flour, spread the sprouted garbanzos out on a baking
sheet and then dry them in a gas oven by the heat of the pilot light
or in an electric oven heated to 250F, then turned off. Don't put the
beans in the oven until you turn it off.  Leave them for about 6
hours. If they are not thoroughly dried, remove them from the oven
and raise the temperature again to 250F, turn off the oven, and
repeat.

When the sprouted beans are thoroughly dried, grind them in a seed
mill, blender or food processor.

Barbara's Milk Chocolate Biscotti

cookies, italian

1 whole blanched almonds -- (7
1 ounces) skinned
7 ounce milk chocolate
1 (heatter uses
1 hershey's symphonybar)
1 3/4 cup sifted unbleached flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 (heatter uses
1 dutch-process cocoa)
1 cup granulated sugar
4 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Toast the almonds in a shallow pan in a preheated 350- degree oven
for 12 to 15 minutes, until lightly colored, shaking the pan once or
twice. You can tell when they are done by the strong smell of toasted
almonds when you open the oven door. Set asid e to cool.

Cut or break the chocolate into small pieces and place it in the bowl
of a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade. Let stand.

Sift together the flour, baking soda, salt, cocoa and sugar. Add
about 1 cup of the flour mixture to the chocolate. Process for about
30 seconds, or until the chocolate is fine and powdery.

In a large bowl, mix together the processed ingredients with the
remaining sifted dry ingredients. Stir in the almonds.

In a small bowl, beat the eggs with the vanilla just to mix. With a
large rubber or wooden spatula stir the egg mixture into the dry
ingredients. You may think there is

Now place two 20-inch lengths of plastic wrap on the work surface.

To shape two loaves, spoon a strip of the dough down the middle of
each piece of plastic wrap. Each strip should be 13 to 14 inches
long. Flatten the tops. Lift the two long sidesof the plastic wrap
(hold them together as close as hands, press on the plastic wrap to
smooth the dough and shape it into an even strip 14 to 15 inches
long, 2 1/2 to 3 inches wide and 3/4 inch thick (no thicker), with
squared ends. If the strips of dough are teaspoon hicker than they should
be, the baked strips will not slice neatly.

Transfer to a cookie sheet and place in the freezer for about 2 hours
(or as much longer as you wish), until firm enough to retain the log
shape when the plastic wrap is removed.

To bake, adjust two racks to divide the oven into thirds. Preheat
oven to 300 degrees. Line two large cookie sheets with baking
parchment or aluminum foil, shiny-side up.

To transfer the frozen dough to the sheets (the dough may still be a
bit sticky; if so, it is okay ), open the two long sides of plastic
wrap on top of one strip of dough and turn the dough upside down on
the lined sheet, placing it diagonally on the sheet. Slowly peel off
the plastic wrap. Repeat with the second strip and the second sheet.

Bake the strips in the preheated oven for 1 hour, reversing the
sheets top to bottom and front to back once during baking to ensure
even baking. During baking the strips will spread out (7 to 8 inches
wide).

After 1 hour of baking, reduce the oven temperature to 275 degrees and
remove the sheets from the oven. Immediately, with a wide metal
spatula, release a strip from the parchment or foil and place it on a
board. Repeat with the second strip.

Use a pot holder or a folded towel to hold one of the hot strips in
place, and use a serrated French bread knife to cut the strip
crosswise into slices 1/2 to
3/4    inch wide.

Repeat with the second strip. Place the slices, standing upright, on
unlined cookie sheets with a little space between them.

Return to oven to bake at 275 degrees for 40 minutes, reversing the
sheets top to bottom and front to back once during baking.

Let cool and store in an airtight container.

After mixing and being shaped, the dough has to spend about 2 hours

bakings, which will total about 1 hour and 40 minutes.

1/2 teaspoon mint extract
1/2 teaspoon mint extract
1/2 cup flour, unbleached

Stir salt and baking powder into flour; stir into butter/sugar
mixture.

Melt chocolate in water over a double-boiler; add to dough. Form into
a long roll approximately 2" - 3" wide. Wrap dough with plastic wrap
and chill overnight.

Slice dough 1/4" thick and place on greased cookie sheet. Sprinkle

400 degree oven for 8 - 10 minutes. Cool cookies on rack.

Vicki's notes:

*  Can substitute 3 ounce. semi-sweet chips for the chocolate.

*  These cookies came about when my husband asked me to make
chocolate-mint cookies for Christmas.  (They are based on the
refrigerator cookies in "Joy of Cooking," with my own variations.)
Although disappointed because he really wanted Girl Scout cookies
(!), everybody else likes them and I've had several requests for the
recipe. (Actually, my husband usually asks for chocolate chip
cookies, no matter what time of year...)

Brownies

cookies, chocolate

8 ounce chocolate, unsweetened (8 squares)
1/2 pound butter
5  eggs
2 1/2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cup flour
2 cup walnuts, coarsely chopped (optional; )

Grease a 13x9 inch pan and pre-heat oven to 375 degrees F.  Melt the
chocolate and the butter in the top of a double boiler over simmering
water.  Whisk until smooth. Set aside to cool while beating eggs.

Beat the eggs, sugar and vanilla at high speed for a full 10 minutes. Blend
in the chocolate-and-butter mixture at low speed.  Add flour, beating just
to blend. Stir in walnuts, if desired.

Bake 30 to 35 minutes.  Do not overbake.  The brownies are done when a
toothpick inserted into the center comes out slightly dirty.  Cool in pan,
then cut into squares.

NOTES:

*  Serious chocolate brownies -- This is an adaptation of the "Scrumptious
Brownies" recipe found on a box of Baker's unsweetened chocolate. I've
reduced the amounts of sugar and flour from the original, which I find
makes for a very fudgey brownie. Yield: 32 brownies.

Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies

candy

2 cup butter
2 cup sugar (granulated, white)
2 cup brown sugar (dark brown)
4 large eggs
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 cup flour (sift before measuring)
5 cup rolled oats (oatmeal), powdered fin; ely
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoon baking powder
24 ounce chocolate chips
8 ounce chocolate bar,finely grated
3 cup chopped nuts

Note I prefer walnuts, but use your favorite

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Cream together the butter and the sugars.

Sift together flour, oatmeal, salt, baking soda, baking powder and shredded
chocolate bar.  Add eggs and vanilla to creamed sugar and butter, then mix
all ingredients together. Mix chocolate chips and nuts into mixture.

Drop by onto ungreased cookie sheet in small drops.  Bake 6 minutes or
until done.

NOTES:

*  Chocolate Chip Cookies like Mrs. Fields makes -- These cookies are a
combination of oatmeal and chocolate chip.  They are very rich, but very
tasty.  The recipe was obtained from a friend of a friend, who supposedly
paid a large amount of money for it. However, the cookies do not taste
exactly the same as the name brand. Yield: approximately 60.

*  A blender works very well to powder the oats and the chocolate bar. The
blender chops the oatmeal finer than a food processor.  The powdered
chocolate bar should melt at the touch of your fingers.

*  I prefer my cookies just barely done, so that they remain chewy. If you
want to send your taste buds into heaven, butter the cookies as they come
out of the oven (still hot), and eat them still warm with a glass of cold
milk.

*  Note that cocoa is not the same thing as a shredded chocolate bar. Note
also that oatmeal is not the same thing as quick-cooking oats or instant
oatmeal.  Oatmeal means "rolled oats," such as Quaker oats.

Chewy Chocolate-Orange Bars

1  raisin puree
3/4 cup chopped bitttersweet
1  chocolate
1/3 cup toasted walnuts, optional
1 tablespoon grated orange zest

Raisin Puree is the basis for the dough of this rich-tasting, chewy
bar. The combination of orange and chocolate is a classic favorite. We
considered cutting the amount of chocolate in the recipe, thereby
cut- ting the fat, but in the end we agreed that the extra richness
is worth the extra grams of fat. (By Times Food Stylists) Sift
together flour, baking powder and salt into large bowl. Stir in oats
and brown sugar. Beat egg whites lightly in another bowl. Stir in
Raisin Puree. Stir into flour mixture along with chocolate, walnuts,
and orange zest just until blended. Spoon in 9-inch-square baking pan
sprayed with non-stick vegetable spray. Bake at 350 degrees F. 25 to
30 minutes. Cool. Cut into 24 bars. 213 calories; 95 mg sodium; 0

butter melts. Do not allow water to boil before butter melts. Rapidly
bring to a boil, remove form heat and add flour all at once. Using a
wooden spoon, stir quickly to form a smooth mixture. Return pan to
medium heat a few seconds and beat well until dough forms a smooth
ball and leaves sides of pan clean.

Remove from heat and cool slightly. Gradually add eggs, a little at a
time, beating well after each addition to form a smooth shiny dough.
Transfer dough to a pastry bag fitted with a 3/4" plain tube. Pipe 24
small balls onto greased baking sheets.

Bake in preheated oven 20 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to
350'F. (175'C.) and continnue cooking 15-20 minutes longer or until
well risen, crisp and sound hollow when tapped on bottoms. Make a
slit in side of each pastry to allow steam to escape. Cool on a wire
rack.

Whip cream, powdered sugar and coffee flavoring until thick. Spoon
into a pastry bag fitted with a small star tube. Pipe cream into
pastry or use a teaspoon to fill pastry with cream. Arrange
profiteroles in a pyramid-shape on a serving dish.

Melt chocolate and remaining butter in a heatproof bowl set over a
pan of gently simmering water. Stir in Tia Maria and corn syrup and
continue stirring until sauce is smooth and coats back of a spoon.
Spoon chocolate sauce over profiteroles and let stand a few minutes.
Mix remaining 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon with superfine sugar and
sprinkle over profiteroles.

Chocolate & Peanut Butter Crescents

cookies, deserts, diabetic

2 cup sifted all purpose flour
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 pound (1 stick) butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1  egg

Sift together the flour, cocoa, and salt and set aside. In the large
bowl of an electric mixer cream the butter. Beat in the vanilla and
sugar. Add the egg and beat until thoroughly mixed. On low speed
gradually add the sifted dry ingredients, scraping the bowl with a
rubber spatula and beating until the mixture holds together. Transfer
the dough to a small bowl for ease in handling and set aside at room
temperature. Prepare the filling.

3/4 cup smooth (not chunky) peanut butter 1/2 cup strained or sifted
confectioners sugar.

In a small bowl thoroughly mix the peanut butter and the sugar.

Adjust rack to the center of the oven and preheat to
325    degrees.

To shape the cookies:  On a large piece of wax paper place the cookie
dough in mounds, using a slightly rounded teaspoon. (no more) of the dough
for each mound-in order not to make them too large it's best to
measure with a measuring spoon.  Do maybe a quarter of the dough at a
time.

Then do the same with the filling, using a level 1/2 measuring
teaspoon for each mound.  Place on other pieces of waxed paper.

Pick up one mound of the dough, roll it between your hands into a
ball, and flatten it between your palms until it is very thin. Then,
with a small metal spatula or a table knife, lift up and place one
mound of the filling in the center of the flattened dough. With your
fingers bring the dough around the filling and pinch the edges to
seal. Roll the filled dough between your hands into a cylindrical
shape about 2 inches long with very slightly tapered ends.  Place the
cookie on an unbuttered cookie sheet and as you do, turn the ends
down slightly to form a short fat crescent. Continue shaping the
cookies and placing them 1/2 to 1 inch apart-these do not spread.

Bake for 13 to 15 minutes, or until the cookies are firm to the touch.
Reverse the cookie sheet front to back once to insure even bakinZ of
sugar and roll the cookies in the sugar as they come out of oven.

2 cup flour
6 tablespoon cocoa powder unsweetened
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup brown sugar, firm pack
1/2 cup bourbon

Combine the flour and cocoa powder, cinnamon and salt in a small
bowl. Set aside. Beat together butter and brown sugar in a large bowl
until creamy and smooth. Beat in bourbon until well blended.
Gradually add dry ingredients to butter mixture, beating well after
each addition. Stir in the chocolate chips. Cover dough with plastic
wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. When ready to bake
cookies, preheat oven to 350~F. Grease 2 large cookie sheets. Beat
together egg whites and water and set aside. Using 1 level tbls.,
shape dough into balls about 1 inch in diameter. Roll each ball first
in the egg whites then in the chopped nuts. Arrange the balls 1/2
inch apart on the prepared cookie sheets. If the dough gets to soft,
periodically return the dough to the refrigerator. Bake the cookies
in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes or until they are still soft
but have a light crackled crust. Cool cookies on the cookie sheets
for 2-5 minutes. Carefully remove the cookies to a wire rack to cool
completely. May use walnuts instead of pecans.

1/2 cup bourbon
3 tablespoon light corn syrup
2 1/2 cup vanilla wafer crumbs
1/2 cup powdered sugar; sifted

Melt chocolate morsels in top of double boiler or in microwave. When
smoothly melted, remove from heat and stir in bourbon and corn syrup.
Set aside.  Combine crumbs, powdered sugar and pecans. Mix well. Stir

Yield: about 5 dozen.  Got this from December '84 issue of Southern
Living magazine. These are wonderful--now a holiday tradition at our
house! You can substitute english walnuts for the pecans. You can
also use rum instead of bourbon. I have tried several combinations,
but find the original the best to my taste.

Chocolate Brown Sugar Cookies

cookies

1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 pound butter
1/3 cup honey
1 large egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1  flour (1.1 c --> glass measuring cu; p filled to the top)
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Cream together the butter and the
brown sugar, add egg and vanilla. Mix well. Add honey.

Measure flour and baking soda (I usually just mix the soda in with the
flour.) Add flour and soda to batter a little at a time and mix. Add
chocolate chips.

Drop by spoonfuls onto an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for 5-8
minutes at 375 degrees F.

NOTES:

*  Chocolate chip cookies with honey and brown sugar.

*  For those of you who like your cookies warm!  I always make up only
enough to eat, and store the batter in the fridge.

*  You can substitute margarine for the butter if you want.

: Difficulty:  easy, though creaming butter and sugar without a food
processor is tedious.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 10 minutes cooking and cooling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.

115 gm flour
2 ml salt
2 1/2 ml baking soda
100 gm butter, softened (1 stick)
60 gm white sugar
60 gm brown sugar
2 1/2 ml vanilla extract
1 large egg
175 gm nestle's chocolate chips (1
1  package)

1.  Preheat oven to 190 øC . Sift flour, salt, baking soda together
in a small bowl.

2.  In another bowl, mix butter with two sugars, vanilla and egg until
smooth. gradually mix dry stuff in with butter mixture. Mix in
chocolate chips.

3.  Put blobs of dough on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake at 190 øC for
8-10 minutes.

Author's Notes: There is no substitute for chocolate-chip cookies,
warm out of the oven, washed down with cold milk. This is Mom's
recipe, and Mom's Mom's recipe. This is also Nestle's ``TollHouse''
recipe, and the Joy of Cooking ``Chocolate-Chip Drop Cookies''
recipe, etc, which is no coincidence. This is the default recipe.
This is not Mrs. Field's recipe. If youwant Mrs. Field's, use a
shopping mall; if you want simple, elegant, timeless chocolate-chip
cookies, use this recipe.

Important: double all proportions above (always make 2x as much of
these as the recipe calls for). Let's face it: small is beautiful,
but big cookies are better than small ones. All the printed recipes
call for teeny cookies, dropped by teaspoonsful onto cookie sheets
(yield 50). My ``blobs of dough'' are golf-ball sized, which makes
healthy 3-4 inch cookies. I invariably make these on the spur of the
moment, and so usually nuke the butter in a microwave to soften it
up. I also occasionally cheat and soften up the butter/sugar mixture
a tad in the oven. Try adding walnuts, macadamias, white chocolate,
orange peel, butterscotch chips, or mint - all these are welcome
variations. But keep it simple.

Difficulty    : easy to moderate. Precision
: measure the ingredients.

Who else besides hillary Clinton uses vegetable shortening in
chocolate chip cookies? Thersa Monk and her 12-year-old daughter,
Krystal, of Germantown, MD., for two.

At least now. For years, the Monks used butter in their baking, but
when they saw an opportunity to compete in the Crisco American Baking
Celbration, they couldn't resist trying to concoct a recipe with
butter flavored Crisco.

The result: Chocolate Chip Macadamia Crunch Cookies, which won the
national $500 prize in the chocolate chip cookie contest in late
March.

With an electric mixer, beat shortening, sugar, brown sugar, eggs,
vanilla and buttermilk for 3-5 minutes until very light and fluffy.
In a separate bowl, mix the flour, oatmeal, baking soda and salt. By
hand, add the shortening mixture and stir well. Add chocolate chips
and nuts and stir by hand.

Refrigerate for at least a half hour until the dough is firm. Drop
dough by the tablespoon, about 2" apart, onto a greased insulated
cookie sheet. Bake in a preheated 325'F. oven for 16-18 minutes until
the cookies are a light golden brown.

Just received a new publication:  THE COOKS BOOKSHELF catalog: "The
Finest Collections of American Cooking"
It is a catalog of "traditional" cookbooks,  many of the community
variety.   (p.o. box 9802-821, Austin, TX 78766). Has lots of neat
cookbooks.  The catalog published the following recipe from the
cookbook "Chockful O' Chips, A Collection of Chocolate Chip Recipes"
by Peggy Seeman.

With the spate of "Mrs. Fields"  and "Niemen Marcus" $250 chocolate
chip cookie recipes, I thought someone might want to try the
following. It does sound good. The author insists that you don't make
substitutions and gives brand names.  Makes it sound authentic,
doesn't it.

Chocolate Madeleines

cookies

2  eggs
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon grated lemon rind; or
2 teaspoon grated orange rind
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa
8 tablespoon butter; melted cooled slightly, p
4 tablespoon butter; softened

PREHEAT OVEN TO 400F. Smear 1/2 teaspoon softened butter over the
inside of each madeleine form. Be sure to completely cover with
butter--don't leave spots. Combine the eggs, sugar and lemon or
orange rind in a large mixing bowl, and stir them together. Set in a
pan of simmering water and stir until the egg mixture is very warm to
your finger. Remove from the heat and beat with a mixer at high speed
until fluffy, pale yellow, and tripled in volume, about 3 minutes.
Add the vanilla and salt. Dump the flour and cocoa into a sifter or
strainer. Sift once, return to sifter or strainer and sprinkle half
of it over the egg mixture, and fold it in. Pour in 8 tablespoons of
butter and sprinkle on the remaining flour, and fold gently just
until the batter is mixed. Spoon a generous tablespoon of batter into
each prepared mold; do not spread it evenly; it will level itself in
the oven. Bake for about 10 minutes, until the edges of the cakes are
golden and they lift easily from the molds. (If you have only 1 pan,
and can bake only 12 at a time, let the mold cool, wipe it out,
grease with butter, then refill with batter and bake again.) Remove
from the oven, slipping the tines of a table fork under each cookie
to free it, and transfer the madeleines to a rack to cool. Serve
within a few hours, or wrap airtight and freeze. Serve plain, or
sprinkle the ribbed side with confectioners' sugar.

Chocolate Malted Cookies

cookies

2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter flavored crisco
1 1/4 cup brown sugar, firmly packed
1/2 cup malted milk powder
2 tablespoon chocolate syrup
1 tablespoon vanilla extract (yes 1 tb)
1 large egg
1 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup milk chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 350-degrees. Get out 2 cookie sheets; no need to
grease them. Mix together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.

In a mixing bowl, combine the shortening, brown sugar, malted milk
powder, chocolate syrup and vanilla. Beat 2 minutes, then add the egg
and beat for a second or two, until mixed.

Gradually add the flour mixture to the creamed mixture, mixing well
between additions. Stir in chocolate morsels and chips. I j used
Guittard's BIG chocolate morsels and their milk chocolate chips. BTW,
these cookies are LOADED with chocolate chips!

Shape dough into 2-inch balls. Place 6 balls of dough onto each cookie
sheet, spacing them 3 inches apart. The cookies are pretty big, not
tiny ones.

Bake for 12-14 minutes, or until golden brown. Mine took 12 minutes.
Don't over-cook them or they'll be hard as a rock.

Cool on cookie sheets for at least 2 minutes or they'll fall apart.
Cool on wire racks.

1/4 teaspoon salt
1  egg
1  sugar
2 pkg andes mints; about 24 mints

ABOUT 4 HOURS BEFORE SERVING OR UP TO 1 WEEK AHEAD:

In a heavy small saucepan over low heat, heat semisweet chocolate
pieces until melted and smooth, stirring occasionally. In a large
bowl with mixer at low speed, beat melted chocolate, flour, butter or
margarine, corn syrup, baking soda, salt, egg, and 1/2 cup sugar
until blended. Increase speed to medium; beat until well mixed,
scraping bowl frequently with rubber spatula.  Wrap dough with
plastic wrap and refrigerate until easy to handle, about two hours
(or place dough in freezer 40 minutes).

Preheat oven to 350 F.  Measure 1/3 cup sugar into a small bowl. With
hands, shape dough into 96 balls; roll balls in sugar to coat. On
ungreased cookie sheets, place balls, about two inches apart.

Bake cookies 12 to 15 minutes until set.  Immediately remove half of
cookies from cookie sheets and invert onto work surface. While they
are still hot, place chocolate-covered mint patties on the cookies on
your work surface.  Then quickly top with remaining cookies, top-side
up, pressing cookies together slightly so the mint patty spreads out
to the cookie edges as it melts.  With a pancake turner, remove the
cookies to wire racks to cool.  Store cookies in a tightly covered
container to use up within 1 week.

Chocolate Moist Madeleines

cookies, christmas

3 tablespoon (plus 1 1/2 teaspoons)
1  unsweetened cocoa
3 tablespoon boiling water
3  large eggs
1 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 1/4 cup sifted cake flour (sift into
1  cup and level off)
3/4 cup (plus 2 tablespoons) sugar
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
13 tablespoon unsalted butter (softened)
      ----SYRUP----
2 tablespoon sugar
1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon kahlua

Preheat oven to 350F.

In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the cocoa and water until
smooth. Allow the mixture to cool to room temperature, then lightly
whisk in the eggs and vanilla extract.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the remaining dry ingredients and mix
on low speed for 30 seconds to blend. Add half the chocolate mixture
and the butter to the dry ingredients. Mix on low speed until the dry
ingredients are moistened.  On medium speed (high speed if using a
hand-held mixer), beat for 1 minute to aerate and develop the
structure. Scrape the sides of the bowl.  Gradually add the remaining
chocolate mixture in 2 batches, beating for 20 seconds after each
addition to incorporate the ingredients and strengthen the structure.
Scrape the sides of the bowl. Scrape the batter into a gallon
capacity freezer bag, close it securely, and cut off a small piece
from one of the corners of the bag. Pipe the batter into buttered
madeleine molds, filling them not quite full. Leave the remaining
batter in the bag, refrigerated, for the following batches.

Bake for 10-12 minutes or until a tester inserted in the center comes
out clean and the madeleines spring back when pressed lightly in the
centers. For even baking, rotate the molds from top to bottom and
front to back halfway through the baking time.

Unmold madeleines onto wire racks to cool completely.

If desired, these madeleines may be brushed with a Kahlua syrup made
as follows:

In a small pan, stir together the sugar and water. Bring to a full
rolling boil.  Cover immediately and remove the pan from the heat.
When cool, swirl in the Kahlua.

If desired, brush the madeleines on both sides with the syrup. Wrap
each one separately in plastic wrap. For the most attractive
appearance, store them without the syrup and brush on the syrup a day
or so before you plan to serve them.

Store in an airtight container at room temperature, or in the
refrigerator or freezer.

Keeps 3 days without syrup, 1 week with syrup, at room temperature; 2
weeks refrigerated; 3 months frozen.

Tips: If you do not have enough madeleine molds to bake all the
batter at one time, store the batter in the refrigerator and bake it
in batches. Rinse out the molds after each batch and butter them.

If you are planning to use the madeleines to dunk, omit the syrup;
madeleines should be a little dry so that they act like sponges. The
syrup helps to preserve the moistness and will greatly extend their
keeping qualities, which is helpful if you are planning to give them
as gifts.

The syrup allows the cookies to keep over 1 week at room temperature.
If you are planning the eat them the same day or the next, omit the
syrup or use only a sprinkle of Kahlua. The subtle coffee flavor
accentuates the chocolate.

Chocolate Morsels

cookies, chocolate

1/2 cup butter or margarine
6 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1  egg yolk
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate

Preparation time: 10 min. Baking time: 15 to 20 min. Oven
temperature: 350 degrees F.

A rich chocolate chip morsel, somewhere between a cookie and a candy.
Easy to bake up a batch and keep on hand.

For 3 dozen cookies you will need:

chips

1. Cream the butter until light.

2. Beat in the brown sugar. Mix until creamy. Add the vanilla and egg
yolk.

3. In a bowl, combine the flour, baking soda and cocoa powder. Add to
the butter mixture.

4. Stir in the chocolate chips.

5. Shape by teaspoon-ful into 1-inch balls. Place on lightly greased
cookie sheets.

6. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove to rack to
cool.

Tips: When "creaming" butter and sugar, the particles of each won't
show up separately. When recipes indicate "blanding", the mixing is
done to a lesser extent.

1  egg white -- whipped
2  squares unsweetened
1  chocolate -- melted
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 teaspoon salt

Preheat oven at 350.  Prepare a cookie sheet with cooking spray. In a
mixing bowl, beat margarine, sugar, egg white, chocolate, and vanilla
until well blended.  Beat in flour andsalt until dough is smooth,
scraping down side of bowl frequently with rubber spatula. Spoon
dough into cookie press fitted with template of desired shape. Press
cookies 2 " apart onto prepared cookie sheets. Bake 10 to 12 minutes,
or until firm. NOTES : When baking on metal , especially at high
temperatures, cookies have a tendency to brown on the bottoms before
centers are done. By stacking two baking sheets together you put an
extra layer of metal under them as well as a thin cushion of air. The
effect is to slow the heat and allow more even baking. Recipe By

Chocolate-Chip Cookies

beverages, eggs, spreads

1 cup flour (plus 2 teaspoon)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup butter, softened (1 stick)
6 tablespoon sugar, white
6 tablespoon brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 large egg
6 ounce nestle's chocolate chips (1 package; )

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Sift flour, salt, baking soda together in a
small bowl.

In another bowl, mix butter with two sugars, vanilla and egg until smooth.
gradually mix dry stuff in with butter mixture.  Mix in chocolate chips.
Put blobs of dough on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F. for
8-10 minutes.

Important: double all proportions above (always make 2 x  as much of these
as the recipe calls for). Let's face it: small is beautiful, but big
cookies are better than small ones. All the printed recipes call for teeny
cookies, dropped by teaspoonsful onto cookie sheets (yield 50). My "blobs
of dough" are golf-ball sized, which makes healthy 3-4 inch cookies.

NOTES:

*  Cookies like what Mom should have made -- There is no substitute for
chocolate-chip cookies, warm out of the oven, washed down with cold milk.
This is Mom's recipe, and Mom's Mom's recipe.  This is also Nestle's "Toll
House" recipe, and the Joy of Cooking "Chocolate-Chip Drop Cookies" recipe,
etc, which is no coincidence. This is the default recipe. This is not Mrs.
Field's recipe. If you want Mrs. Field's, use a shopping mall; if you want
simple, elegant, timeless chocolate-chip cookies, use this recipe. Yield:
12 big cookies.

*  I invariably make these on the spur of the moment, and so usually nuke
the butter in a microwave to soften it up. I also occasionally cheat and
soften up the butter/sugar mixture a tad in the oven.

*  Try adding walnuts, macadamia, white chocolate, orange peel,
butterscotch chips, or mint, all these are welcome variations. But keep it
simple.

Chocolate-Dipped Biscotti

cookies, italian

1 cup sugar
1/2 cup butter, sweet; melted & cooled
2 tablespoon pernod
1 1/2 tablespoon bourbon
2 tablespoon anise seed
3 large egg
1 cup almonds; chopped
2 1/4 cup flour
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
12 ounce chocolate chips; semi-sweet
2 tablespoon shortening

In a large mixing bowl, stir together the sugar and melted butter.
Add the Pernod, bourbon and anise seed. Beat in the eggs, then stir
in the nuts. Sift the dry ingredients together. Gently stir in the
dry ingredients until well incorporated.  Cover with plastic wrap and
chill for about three hours.

Preheat the oven to 375 F.  Butter two cookie sheets. Shape the dough
on cookie sheets into three loaves, well spaced. Each loaf should be
about two inches wide and 1/2" thick. Bake for about 20 minutes,
until the loaves puff up and brown.

When the loaves are cool enough to touch, cut each loaf into diagonal
slices about 1/2" thick.  Lay the slices on their cut sides and toast
them at 375 F. for an additional 15 minutes or until lightly browned.
Cool.

Dip biscotti in chocolate the day they are to be served. In the top
of a double boiler, melt the chocolate chips with the shortening,
stirring frequently.  (If you're *really* ambitious, add a little
chocolate wax to get a good do on it.)  Remove from heat and stir
until a candy thermometer read 85 F. Holding each cookie by its
bottom, gently dip the tops into chocolate.  Turn immediately and
allow to dry, uncoated side down, on wax paper.  Repeat until all are
done.

Chocolate-Gilded Danish Sugar Cones

cookies

1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2  egg whites
1 teaspoon vanilla
3 ounce bittersweet chocolate or
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 400'F. Generously grease 4 cookie sheets. Beat butter
and sugar in large bowl until light and fluffy. Blend in flour. In
clean, dry bowl, beat egg whites until frothy. Blend into butter
mixture with vanilla.

Using measuring teaspoon, place 4 mounds of dough, 4" apart, on each
prepared cookie sheet. Spread mounds with back of spoon dipped in
water to 3" diameter. Bake, 1 sheet at a time, 5-6 minutes or until
edges are just barely golden. (Do not overbake or cookies become
crisp too quickly and are difficult to shape.) Remove from oven and
quickly loosen each cookie from cookie sheet with thin spatula. Shape
each into a cone; cones become firm as they cool. (If cookies become
too firm to shape, return to oven for a few seconds to soften.)

Melt chocolate in small bowl over hot, not boiling, water. Stir until
smooth. When all cookies are baked and cooled, dip flared ends into
melted chocolate. Let stand until chocolate is set. If desired, serve
cones by standing them in a bowl. (Adding about 1" of sugar to bottom
of bowl may be necessary to hold them upright.)

covered rolling pin, well-dusted with powdered sugar, roll the
mixture on a board, also liberally dusted with 10X sugar, until it is
1/4-inch thick. With a 1 1/2-inch cutter dipped in 10X sugar, cut the
meringue into small circles. Reroll the scraps and cut as many
meringues as possible. Space the meringues about 1 1/2 inches apart
on baking sheets. The baking sheets should be liberally dusted with
flour. Bake them uncovered for 15 minutes. Cool the meringues for
about 5 minutes on the baking sheets; then, with a spatula, carefully
loosen them. Transfer them to wire racks. When they are cool, store

Cookies~ Chocolate Chip~ Bureaucrat's~ Guide

cookies, chocolate, deserts

      ----TOTAL LEAD TIME: 35 MINUTES----
      ----INPUTS----
1 cup brown sugar, packed
1/2 cup sugar, granualated
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup shortening
2  eggs
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cup flour, all-purpose
1 teaspoon soda, baking
1/2 teaspoon salt
12 ounce chocolate pieces, semi-sweet
1 cup pecans, chopped

GUIDANCE:

1.) After procurement actions, decontainerize inputs. Perform
measurement tasks on a case-by-case basis.  In a mixing type bowl,
impact heavily on brown sugar, granulated sugar, softened butter and
shortening. Coordinate the interface of eggs and vanilla, avoiding an
overrun scenario to the bes of your skills and abilities.

2.) At this point in time, leverage flour, baking soda and salt into
a bowl and aggregate.  Equalize with prior mixture and develop
intense and continuous liaison among inputs until well-coordinated.
Associate key chocolate and nut subsystems and execute stirring
operations.

3.) Within this time frame, take action to prepare the heating
environment for throughput by manually setting the baking unit (by
hand) to a temperature of 375 degrees =F8F (190 degrees C). Drop
mixture in an ongoing fashion from a teaspoon type instrument in an
ongoing fashion onto an ungreased cookie sheet at intervals
sufficient enough apart to permit total and permanent separationof
throughputs to the maximum extent practicable under operating
conditions.

4.) Position cookie sheet in bake situation and surveil for 8 to 10
minutes or until cooking action terminates. Initiate coordination of
outputs within the cooling rack function. Containerize, wrap in red
tape and disseminate to authorized staff personnel on a timely and
expeditious basis.

OUTPUT: Six dozen official government chocolate chip cookie units.

Cream Cheese Chocolate Chip Pizza (Soft)

cookies, deserts

1 cup butter-margarine; softened
3/4 cup sugar
3/4 cup brown sugar
8 ounce cream cheese; softened
1 teaspoon vanilla
2  eggs
2 1/4 cup all purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
12 ounce semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Preheat oven to 375. Lightly grease two 12 inch pizza pans. Cream
butter, sugars, cream cheese and vanilla in large bowl. Add eggs,
beat until light.

Combine flour, baking soda and salt in small bowl. Add to creamed
mixture; blend well.  Stir in chocolate chips and walnuts (if used)

Divide dough in half, spread each half evenly into prepared pans.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT SPREAD ALL THE WAY TO EDGES, THIS DOUGH DOES SPREAD
Leave about a half inch space between edge of dough and rim of pizza
pan.

Bake 20 to 30 minutes or until lightly browned.  Cool completely in
pans on wire racks.

To serve: cut into slim wedges.

Personal note:  When these were brown and ready to take out of the
oven they had a soft consistency - much like that of a soft batch
cookie. I wanted a firmer cookie. Put them both back in the oven, and
turned the off. Let sit for 1 hour hoping they then became more like
a chocolate chip cookie.  They never crisped up, but remained soft.
Still tasted good.

8 ounce swiss semisweet chocolate, cut into; small chunks

Crisp outsides and chewy centers, are often achieved by undercooking.
In this recipe a small amount of corn syrup is substituted for some
of the granualted sugar, for a chewy texture without being soft or
undercooked. Store cookies in the refrigerator. Mix flour with soda
and salt. Set aside. With an electric mixer, cream the butter until
softened. Add sugar; cream until light and fluffy. Blend in the corn
syrup, scraping down the bowl often. Blend in the lightly beaten
eggs, and vanilla and almond extracts. If the mixture seems curlded
or unhomogenous, add a bit of the flour mixture to bind it. Stir dry
ingredients into creamed mixture, scraping down sides of bowl
occasionally. Stir in chocolate pieces gently by hand. Chill batter
20 minutes. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Drop by rounded
teaspoonfuls onto parchment-lined baking sheets. Flatten cookies very
slightly. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 12 minutes, or until cookies are

Esther Eskelson's Danish Raspberry Cookies

cookies, chocolate, christmas, scandinavia

2  1 ounce squares unsweetened chocola
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup sugar
1  egg
2 cup cake flour
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk chocolate or white
1  chocolate chips or a mixture
1 cup seedless raspberry preserves

Melt chocolate in top of a double boiler over hot not boiling water.
Remove from heat and cool. Cream butter and sugar in a large bowl
until light. Add egg and melted chocolate; beat until fluffy. Stir in
cake flour, vanilla and salt until well blended. Cover and
refrigerate until firm, about 1 hr.

Preheat oven to 400. Lightly grease cookie sheets or line with
parchment paper. Divide dough into 4 equal parts and divide each part
into two pieces. Roll each piece into a rope 12" long on a lightly
floured board. The ropes should be about the thickness of a finger.
Place 2" apart on the prepared cookie sheets. With your finger tip,
make an indentation along the length of each rope. Bake 8 min or
until firm.

Meanwhile melt the chocolate chips in a small bowl over hot water. If
you are using both kinds of chocolate, melt separately. Stir until
smooth. Stir preserves and spoon them into a pastry bag fitted with a
1/4" tip. [You can use a plastic bag with a corner snipped off with
scissors.]

When you remove the cookies from the oven, press preserves down the
indentation in each cookie strip. Return to the oven for 2 min and
remove to wire racks. While cookies are still warm, drizzle melted
chocolate over the tops and cut into 1" diagonal pieces. Refrigerate
until the chocolate has set.

This recipe was learned by my mate Roslind many Christmases ago from
her first husband's grandmother, Esther Eskelson and has been a
family favorite ever since.

2 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter -- softened
3/4 cup granulated sugar
3/4 can brown sugar, packed
2 teaspoon vanilla
2  extra large eggs
24 ounce chocolate chips -- (2
1  packages)

Preheat oven to 375F.  Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a
bowl, set aside. Cream together butter, granulated sugar, brown
sugar, and vanilla. Do not over beat mixture. Add eggs one at a time,
combining well after each addition.  Gradually stir in flour mixture.
Stir in chocolate chips, in 2 or 3 additions, mixing well. Drop by
rounded tablespoon onto ungreased cookie sheets.  Bake for
approximately 10 minutes, until lightly browned and centers have just
set - they should look almost a bit underdone. Let stand for 10 to 15
minutes to cool before moving to wire racks to finish cooling.

Cookies will be more moist than from standard recipes, and will pull
apart easily when very warm.

Hungarian Chocolate Cream Bars

cookies, chocolate, hungarian

      ----CAKE----
4 large eggs, separated
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
2/3 cup sugar, divided
3/4 cup sweet butter, room temp.
9 tablespoon cocoa powder
1/2 cup sifted all-purpose flour
      ----FILLING----
2 cup heavy cream
12 ounce semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 tablespoon powdered instant coffee
1/8 cup rum
      ----GLAZE----
5 ounce semi-sweet chocolate
1 ounce unsweetened chocolate
4 tablespoon sweet butter
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon karo syrup

Of all my recipes, this is the only one that I have never given
out-its raves convinced me in earlier years to keep it only as my
own. It is singularly the best chocolate dessert I have ever tasted!

Editor's Note: This recipe contains rum. If you prefer not to use
rum, the brownies still taste fantastic.

To make cake: preheat oven to 350ø. Grease 9 x 13-inch pan. Line pan
with wax paper and grease the wax paper.

Beat the egg whites lightly, add cream of tartar and beat at a high
speed. When shiny, gradually add 1/3 cup of sugar, continuing to beat
until stiff.

In a separate mixing bowl, place the egg yolks, remaining sugar and
butter and beat until light and fluffy. Add the cocoa and mix
thoroughly. Add a large dollop of egg whites to chocolate mixture and
whip until blended. Then pour the rest of the egg whites over the egg
mixture and sprinkle the flour over the egg whites. Fold gently with
a spatula until the egg whites and flour are incorporated.

Immediately spread the batter in the prepared pan. Smooth out to
edges and corners. Bake 10-15 minutes at 350ø until cake is done. Run
a knife around edges and invert cake on a wire rack to cool.

To make filling: in a saucepan, combine cream, chocolate chips and
instant coffee. Cook over low heat until mixture is smooth and
slightly thickened. Cover saucepan and refrigerate until very cold.
When chilled, add rum and whip in a chilled bowl at medium speed
until firm. Be careful not to over beat or the filling may separate.

To make glaze (do not make this until all other steps are
completed): in a small saucepan, melt all ingredients over a low
flame. Mix until very smooth. Cool for 15 minutes and mix again. Use
immediately, as the sauce thickens as it cools.

To assemble, cut cake horizontally into halves. Lightly sprinkle
bottom half with rum. Spread filling over bottom layer. Place top
layer on bottom half and spread filling over top. Refrigerate or
freeze until very firm. When very cold, set the cake on a wire rack.
Pour the warm glaze over the cake. Refrigerate again until firm. Cut
with a sharp knife, wiping the blade after each cut. You can freeze
cut squares.

NOTES:

These cookies are great.  They are very sweet though. I've only used
an egg white when I've made these. Also, the dough is kind of
crumbly. I ended up kind of forming them with a spoon and my hands
into little balls. My experience was that they only took about 8
minutes to bake. I let them cool on the sheets for about 5 minutes
before easily moving them to cooling racks.  The dough makes them
look like they're not going to turn out, but I was pleasantly
surprised the first time I made them. You won't be able to tell that
they're low calorie and low fat. ENJOY! Let me know if you like them.

Martha Stewart's Fall Leaf Tuile Cookies

cookies, chocolate, holiday

      ----CHOCOLATE TUILE BATTER----
1/2 cup unsalted butter; room temperature
2/3 cup confectioner's sugar
4 large egg whites
1 cup all purpose flour
3 tablespoon dutch process cocoa powder
      ----WHITE TUILE BATTER----
1/2 cup unsalted butter; room temperature
2/3 cup confectioner's sugar
4 large egg whites
1 cup all purpose flour

Traditionally, tuiles are thin, crisp almond cookies that are gently
molded over a rolling pin or arched form while they are still warm.
Once set, their shape ressembles the curved French roofing tiles for
which they're named. Create an autumnal variation on the classic
French tuile cookie by shaping them with a leaf- shaped stencil. The
basic tuile dough of sugar, nuts, eggs, flour, and butter can be
enhanced by flavorings such as chocolate, vanilla, lemon or orange.
These delicate cookies are delicious served alone, or along side a
bowl of ice cream.

To make leaf-shaped tuiles, Martha Stewart cuts stencils shaped like
maple and oak leaves from the tops of plastic containers. She places
the stencils on a baking sheet lined with a nonstick baking mat. She
forms the cookies by spreading a thin layer of dough inside the open
part of the stencil. After removing the stencil form, she decorates
each leaf cookie by piping "veins" with a pastry bag filled with a
contrasting dough before baking. Work quickly when removing the
cookies from the oven because if you wait too long the cookies will
harden on the baking sheet and won't be flexible enough to curve over
the rolling pin. If this happens, you can return the baking sheet to
the oven for a few seconds, and try again. This recipe uses
Dutch-process cocoa, known for its rich flavor and color.

1. Sift flour with cocoa, and set aside.

2. In bowl of an electric standing mixer with paddle attachment, beat
butter and sugar on medium, until well combined, about 2 minutes.
Beat in egg whites, one at a time, beating for 4 minutes after each
addition. Add the flour-and-cocoa mixture, and mix until just
combined.

3. Reserve 1/2 cup batter; place in a pastry bag fitted with a #2 tip
and set aside for piping white tuile cookies.

Yield: 100 cookies



Martha Stewart's Favorite Cookie (Alexis' Brown Sugar Cho

cookies, chocolate

2 cup unsalted butter (4 sticks)
1 cup granulated sugar
3 cup brown sugar; firmly packed
4 each eggs, add one at a time
2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
3 1/2 cup all purpose flour
2 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup best quality chocolate chips

Alexis Stewart developed this chocolate-chip cookie recipe for her
mother, Martha, when she was twelve years old. Best enjoyed with a
cold glass of milk, these flat buttery cookies combine perfect
amounts of crunch and chewiness. Use an ice-cream scoop to make
evenly sized cookies. If cookies harden before you have a chance to
remove them from the baking sheet, return the sheet to the oven for a
few seconds to soften the dough for easier removal.

1. Heat oven to 375 B0. Cream butter until smooth; add sugars. Beat
in eggs and vanilla. Sift together dry ingredients, and slowly beat
into wet mixture. Fold in chocolate-chips.  Chill dough until firm,
at least
15    minutes.

2. Drop 2 to 3 tablespoons chilled batter per cookie onto a
well-greased baking sheets lined with baking mats or parchment; space
batter about 2 inches apart for spreading.  Bake 8 to 10 minutes,
until golden. Remove from baking sheets, and allow to cool on baking
racks.

Steve's Chocolate Chip Cookies

beverages, eggs, spreads

1/2 pound butter (2 sticks)
1 1/2 cup dark brown sugar
2  eggs
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cup flour, all-purpose
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 pound chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Cream butter and sugar in a mixing bowl
until creamy. Spend some time and make sure it is well mixed. Add eggs and
vanilla and mix well. Add flour and soda, again mixing well. Add chocolate
chips. If it doesn't look like enough, then add some more.

Make big, thick cookies, big enough so that you get only 2 dozen of them
out of this recipe. Put them on a lightly-greased baking sheet. Put the
cookies in the oven, close the door quickly, and turn the heat down to 350
degrees F. Bake for 10 minutes.

NOTES:

*  Rich, thick, crunchy chocolate chip cookies.  Yield:  makes 2 dozen.

*  The use of real ingredients instead of imitation ingredients cannot be
overemphasized.  Chocolate-flavored chips, margarine, vanilla flavoring and
other such atrocities will completely destroy this recipe. I use Challenge
butter and Ghirardelli chocolate.

: Difficulty:  easy if you have a machine that can cream sugar and butter,
moderate otherwise.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 10 minutes cooking, 10 minutes cooling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.

Super Chunky Cookies

cookies, chocolate, godiva

2 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 cup unsalted butter -- softened
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 cup packed light brown sugar
2 large eggs -- room temperature
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup mini semisweet chocolate --
1  chips
1 cup milk chocolate chips
4 ounce bittersweet chocolate --
1  cut
1  inch chunks
2 ounce white chocolate -- coarsely
1/2 cup pecans; coarsely chopped
3/4 cup english toffe bits

Position one rack in the top and another in the bottom third of the
oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.

In a medium bowl, using a wire whisk, stir together the flour, baking
soda and salt until thoroughly blended.

In the 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, using the
paddle attachment, beat the butter for 30 seconds at medium speed,
until creamy. Add the sugars and continue beating for 3 to 4 minutes,
until the mixture is light in texture and color. Scrape down the
sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the eggs one at a time,
beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla.

At low speed, beat in the flour mixture a third at a time, scraping
down the sides of the bowl after each addition. Using a wooden spoon,
stir in all the chocolate chips, the bittersweet chocolate and white
chocolate. Stir in the pecans and toffee bits. The dough will be very
stiff.

Drop the dough by slightly rounded tablespoonfuls onto 2 ungreased
baking sheets, leaving about 1 1/2 inches between the cookies.
Refrigerate the remaining dough. Bake the cookies for 11 to 13
minutes, or until the cookies are set and the edges are very lightly
browned; switch the positions of the baking sheets halfway through
the baking time for even browning.

Cool the cookies on the baking sheets on wire racks for 1 to 2
minutes. Using a metal spatula, transfer the cookies to wire racks to
cool completely. Repeat with the remaining dough. The cookies can be
stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days
or frozen for up to 1 month.

The $250.00 Neiman-Marcus Cookie Recipe

cookies, chocolate

2 cup butter
4 cup flour
2 teaspoon baking soda
2 cup granulated sugar
2 cup brown sugar
5 cup blended oatmeal (powder
1  oatmeal in blender after
1  measuring)
24 ounce chocolate chips
1 teaspoon salt
1 each 8 ounce hershey bar (grated)
4 each eggs
2 teaspoon baking powder
3 cup chopped nuts (your choice)
2 teaspoon vanilla

Cream the butter and both sugars.  Add eggs and vanila: mix together
with flour, oatmeal, salt, baking powder, and soda. Add chocolate
chips, Hershey Bar and nuts.  Roll into balls and place two inches
apart on a cookie sheet.  Bake for 10 minutes at 375 degrees.

The following is a TRUE STORY:

My daughter and I had just finished a salad at Neiman-Marcus Cafe in
Dallas and decided to have a small dessert. Because both of us are such
cookie lovers, we decided to try the "Neiman-Marcus Cookie". It was
so excellent that I asked if they would give me the recipe and the
waitress said with a small frown "I'm afraid not." "Well" I said,
"would you let me buy the recipe?"   With a cute smile, she said
"YES". I asked how much and she responded, " Only two fifty, it's a
great deal!" I said with approval, "just add it to my tab".

Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement from Neiman-Marcus
and it was $285.00.  I looked again and remembered I had only spent
$9.95 for two salads and about $20.00 for a scarf. As I glanced at
the bottom of the statement, it said,  "Cookie Recipe - $250.00".
That's outrageous!! I called Neiman's Accounting Dept. and told them
that the waitress said it was "two - fifty," which clearly does not
mean "two hundred and fifty dollars"  by any POSSIBLE interpretation
of the phrase. Neiman-Marus refused to budge. They would not refund
my money, because according to them,  " What the waitress told you is
not our problem. You have already seen the recipe - we absolutely
will not refund your money at this point." I explained to her the
criminal statutes which govern fraud in Texas, I threatened to refer
them to the Better Business Bureau and the State's Attorney General
for engaging in fraud. I was basically told, " Do what you want, we
don't give a crap, and we're not refunding your money." I waited a
moment, thinking of how I could get even, or even try to get any of
my money back. I just said "Okay, you folks got my $250, and now I'm
going to have $250.00 worth of fun." I told her that I was going to
see to it that every cookie lover in the United States with an e-mail
account has a $250.00 cookie recipe from Neiman-Marcus... for free.
She replied, " I wish you wouldn't do this" I said, " Well you should
have thought of that before you ripped me off, and slammed down the
phone on her.

So, here it is !!!  Please, please,  please pass it on to everyone
you can possibly think of.  I paid $250 dollars for this... I don't
want Neiman-Marcus to ever get another penny off of this recipe...

White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cookies

cookies, chocolate

1 cup flour -- plus 2 tb
1 tablespoon salt -- (i usually use
1  less)
1/2 tablespoon baking soda
4 ounce butter or margarine
6 tablespoon brown sugar, packed
6 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla
1  egg
1/2 cup white chocolate chunks -- *
1  see note
1/2 cup macadamia nuts -- ** see
1  note

* I buy large good quality candy bars, such as Lindt, and chop them
up. ** I use straight from the jar, you may prefer to chop up

Preheat oven to 375 F Mix all dry ingredients together in a separate
bowl In a large bowl, cream butter and sugars until fluffy. Add
vanilla and egg--mix well. Slowly add dry ingredients to butter/sugar
mixture--mix well Add chocolate and nuts Spoon onto lightly greased
cookie sheets (I use cushionaire--no burning) Make whatever size you
what--I tend to make them large because it saves time Bake 8-12
minutes, depending on size of cookies--they should not brown, more of
a golden color Cool on rack

BTW:  I usually make a double batch of the dough, separate into
halves, and add regular chocolate chunks and pecans to one (and maybe
some coconut), white chocolate and macadamias to the other--two
cookies with half the work

World's Best Chocolate Chip Cookies

cookies, chocolate

3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup butter
1 tablespoon vanilla
2  eggs, slightly beaten
3 cup flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
3 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 cup chopped nuts (optional)

This recipe is said to have come from a famous cookie maker. So make,
bake, and compare to see if these cookies aren't "the real thing." One
feature that distinguishes these cookies from traditional chocolate
chip cookies is their perfect size. It comes from using a small size
ice cream scoop to drop them onto the cookie sheet.

Preheat oven to 350ø.

In a large bowl, combine sugars; add in butter and cream together
with the sugar. Add vanilla and eggs; mix together.

In a separate bowl sift the dry ingredients and add to the creamed
mixture. Mix well; the dough will be stiff. Add the chocolate chips
and nuts (if using).

Line the cookie sheets with baking parchment or wax paper. Drop
dough with a small ice cream scoop onto the sheets. Bake 10-12
minutes at 350ø. Remove from oven and cool on wire racks.

Variation: For ice cream sandwiches, turn one cookie face down,
place a scoop of ice cream on it and top with another cookie.

mix in individual zip-lock bags. TO MAKE THE COOKIES: Stir the mix to
distribute the nuts and chips and then, measure seven level cups of
the mix into a large bowl. (* spoon in and level, do not pack) Stir
to distribute the nuts and chips. Add two large eggs that have been
lightly beaten and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. Blend well. This
